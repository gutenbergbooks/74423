<p class="po">In preparing this translation of the Life of Augustus,
the text of L. Dindorf,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historici Graeci Minores</span>, Leipsic
1871, vol. 1, has been used as a basis. Suggestions of K.
Müller,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum</span>, Paris 1874, vol. 3,
pp. 427 ff., and of N. Piccolos, Nicolas de Damas,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vie de César</span>, Paris 1850,
have been found of value. The last
named work treats only of the section found in the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Escorialensis</span>’,
namely chapters 16 to 31. In cases of variation
among these three editors, the preferred reading has
been duly indicated in the commentary; departures from their
texts have also been noted. Works which have been of value
in preparing the commentary have been fully cited therein.</p>

<p class="po">To obviate the confusion between the elder and the
younger Caesar, which exists through the excerpt, it has
been found expedient to refer to the later Augustus as
Octavius uniformly until his arrival in Italy from Apollonia,
when he became acquainted with the contents of Caesar’s will,
and thereafter as Octavian.</p>

<p class="po">All the references to Appian are to his ‘Civil Wars’.</p>

<p class="po">The writer here wishes to express his obligation to
Professor T. Frank, under whose direction this work was
undertaken, to Professor W. P. Mustard, who has kindly read
the entire manuscript of the translation, and to Professors
C. W. E. Miller and D. M. Robinson.</p>

<h3>The Life of Augustus</h3>
</div>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">1.</span>Men gave him this name<a id="FA_1" href="#FN_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in view of his claim
to honor; and, scattered over islands and continents,
through city and tribe, they revere him by building
temples and by sacrificing to him,<a id="FA_2" href="#FN_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> thus requiting
him for his great virtue and acts of kindness toward
themselves. For this man, having attained preeminent
power and discretion, ruled over the greatest number
of people within the memory of man, established the
furthest boundaries for the Roman Empire, and settled
securely not only the tribes of Greeks and barbarians,
but also their dispositions; at first with arms but
afterward even without arms, by attracting them of
their own free will. By making himself known through
kindness he persuaded them to obey him. The names
of some of them men had never heard before, nor had
they been subject within the memory of anyone, but he
subdued them: all those that live as far as the
Rhine<a id="FA_3" href="#FN_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and beyond the Ionian<a id="FA_4" href="#FN_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Sea and the Illyrian
peoples. These are called Pannonians and Dacians.<a id="FA_5" href="#FN_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
(See the work: ‘Concerning Brave Honest Deeds.’)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span><a id="FA_6" href="#FN_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">2.</span>To set forth 	the full power of this man’s intelligence
and virtue, both in the administration which
he exercised at Rome and in the conduct of great wars
both domestic and foreign, is a subject for competition
in speech and essay, that men may win renown by treating
it well. I myself shall relate his achievements,
so that all can know the truth. First I shall speak
of his birth and breeding, his parents, his nurture
and education from infancy, by means of which he came
to such an estate.<a id="FA_7" href="#FN_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p class="pt1">His father was Caius Octavius, a man of senatorial
rank.<a id="FA_8" href="#FN_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
His forebears, renowned for both wealth<a id="FA_9" href="#FN_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and justice, left their estates to him, an orphan, at
their death.<a id="FA_10" href="#FN_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
His guardians<a id="FA_11" href="#FN_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
spent his money, but he remitting his just claims was satisfied
with the remainder.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">3.</span>Octavius at
the age of about nine years was an object of no little admiration
to the Romans, exhibiting as he did great excellence of nature,
young though he was; for he gave an oration<a id="FA_12" href="#FN_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
before a large crowd and received much applause from grown men.
After his grandmother’s death he was brought up by his mother
Atia<a id="FA_13" href="#FN_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and her husband
Lucius Philippus, who was a descendant of the conquerors of Philip of
Macedonia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span><a id="FA_14" href="#FN_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
At Philippus’ house, as if at his father’s, Octavius
was reared and showed great promise, already seeming
to be treated with respect by his comrades, the children
of highest birth. Many of them associated with
him, and even not a few of the youths who had hopes
to undertake affairs of state. Daily many lads, men,
and boys of his own age attended him whether he rode
on horseback outside of the town or went to the house
of his relations or of any other person; for he exercised
his mind with the finest practices and his body
with both genteel and warlike pursuits; and more quickly
than his teachers he himself applied his lesson to
the facts in hand, so that for this reason also much
praise redounded to him in the city.<a id="FA_15" href="#FN_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Both his
mother and her husband Philippus took care of him,
inquiring each day from the instructors<a id="FA_16" href="#FN_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and curators
whom they had placed in charge of the boy what
he had accomplished, how far he had advanced, or how
he had spent the day and with whom he had associated.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">4.</span>At the time when the
Civil War had laid hold on
the city,<a id="FA_17" href="#FN_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
his mother Atia and Philippus quietly
sent Octavius off to one of his father’s country
places.<a id="FA_18" href="#FN_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p class="pt1">He entered the forum, aged about fourteen,
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
put off the toga praetextata and assume the toga virilis,
this being a token of his becoming registered as a man.<a id="FA_19" href="#FN_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Then while all the citizens looked upon him, because of
his comeliness and very evidently noble descent, he
sacrificed to the gods and was registered in the sacred
college in the place of Lucius Domitius, who had died.<a id="FA_20" href="#FN_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
The people indeed had very eagerly elected<a id="FA_21" href="#FN_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> him to
this position. Accordingly, he performed the sacrifice,
adorned with the toga virilis and at the same time the
honors of a very high priestly office.<a id="FA_22" href="#FN_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Nevertheless,
though he was registered as of age according to law,
his mother would not let him leave the house other
than as he did before, when he was a child, and she
made him keep to the same mode of life and sleep in
the same apartment as before. For he was of age only
by law and in other respects was taken care of as a
child. He did not change the fashion of his clothes,
but continued to use the Roman garb.<a id="FA_23" href="#FN_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">5.</span>He went to the temples on the regular days, but
after dark on account of his youthful charm, seeing
that he attracted many women by his comeliness and
high lineage; though often tempted by them he seems
never to have been enticed. Not only did the watchful
care of his mother, who guarded him and forbade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
his wandering, protect him but he too was prudent now
that he was advancing in age. During the Latin festival
when the consuls had to ascend the Alban Mount to
perform the customary sacrifices,<a id="FA_24" href="#FN_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the priests meanwhile
succeeding to the jurisdiction of the consuls,
Octavius sat on the tribunal in the centre of the forum.<a id="FA_25" href="#FN_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
And there came many people on legal business<a id="FA_26" href="#FN_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and many on no business at all except for a sight of
the boy; for he was well worth beholding especially
when he assumed the dignity and honorable aspect of
office.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">6.</span>Caesar had by this time completed the wars in
Europe,<a id="FA_27" href="#FN_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> had conquered Pompey in Macedonia,<a id="FA_28" href="#FN_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> had
taken Egypt,<a id="FA_29" href="#FN_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> had returned from Syria and the Euxine<a id="FA_30" href="#FN_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
sea, and was intending to advance into Libya<a id="FA_31" href="#FN_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> in order
to put down what was left of war over there; and Octavius
wanted to take the field with him in order that
he might gain experience in the practice of war. But
when he found that his mother Atia was opposed he said
nothing by way of argument but remained at home. It
was plain that Caesar, out of solicitude for him, did
not wish him to take the field yet, lest he might bring
on illness to a weak body through changing his mode of
life and thus permanently injure his health.
For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
this cause he took no part in the expedition.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">7.</span>After finishing that war also, Caesar returned to
Rome,<a id="FA_32" href="#FN_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> having granted pardon to a very few of the captives
who fell to him because they had not learned wisdom
in the earlier wars.<a id="FA_33" href="#FN_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Then the following incident
occurred: There was a particular associate and friend
of Octavius, Agrippa,<a id="FA_34" href="#FN_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> who had been educated at the
same place and who was a very special friend of his.
His brother was with Cato and treated with much respect;
he had participated in the Libyan War, but was at this
time taken captive. Although Octavius had never yet
asked anything of Caesar he wanted to beg the prisoner
off, but he hesitated because of modesty and at the
same time because he saw how Caesar was disposed toward
those who had been captured in that war. However, he
made bold to ask it, and had his request granted.
Thereupon he was very glad at having rescued a brother
for his friend and he was praised by others for employing
his zeal and right of intercession first of all
for a friend’s safety.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">8.</span>After this,
Caesar celebrated his triumphs for the
Libyan War and the others which he had fought;<a id="FA_35" href="#FN_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and he ordered the young Caesar, whom he had now adopted, and
who was in a way a son even by nature, on account of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the closeness of their relationship,<a id="FA_36" href="#FN_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> to follow his
chariot, having bestowed upon him military decorations,
as if he had been his aide in war. Likewise at the
sacrifices and when entering the temples he stationed
him at his side and he ordered the others to yield
precedence to him. Caesar already bore the rank of
Imperator, which was the highest according to the
Roman usage,<a id="FA_37" href="#FN_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and he was highly esteemed in the state.
The boy, being his companion both at the theatre and
at the banquets, and seeing that he conversed kindly
with him, as if with his own son, and having by this
time become somewhat more courageous, when many of his
friends and citizens asked him to intercede for them
with Caesar, in matters in which they were in need of
aid, looking out for the opportune moment he respectfully
asked and was successful; and he became of
great value to many of his kinsfolk, for he took care
never to ask a favor at an inopportune time, nor when
it was annoying to Caesar. And he displayed not a few
sparks of kindness and natural intelligence.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">9.</span>Caesar wished Octavius to have the experience of
directing the exhibition of theatrical productions
(for there were two theatres,<a id="FA_38" href="#FN_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> the one Roman, over
which he himself had charge, and the other Greek).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
This he turned over to the care of Octavius. The latter,
wishing to exhibit interest and benevolence in
the matter, even in the hottest and longest days, never
left his post before the end of the play; with the result
that he fell ill, for he was young and unaccustomed
to toil. Being very ill, every one felt considerable
apprehension regarding him, lest a constitution
such as his might suffer some mishap, and Caesar
most of all. Accordingly, every day he either called
himself and encouraged him or else sent friends to do
so, and he kept physicians in continuous attendance.
On one occasion word was brought to him while he was
dining that Octavius was relaxed and was dangerously
ill. He sprang up and ran barefooted to the place
where the patient was, and in great anxiety and with
great emotion questioned the physicians, and he sat
down by the bedside himself. When Octavius’ full
recovery<a id="FA_39" href="#FN_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> was brought about he showed much joy.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">10.</span>While Octavius was convalescent, still weak physically
though entirely out of danger, Caesar had to
take the field on an expedition<a id="FA_40" href="#FN_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> in which he had previously
the intention of taking the boy. This however he could not now do on
account of his attack of sickness. Accordingly, he left him behind in the care
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
a number of persons who were to take particular
charge of his mode of life; and giving orders that
if Octavius should grow strong enough, he was to follow
him, he went off to the war. The eldest son of
Pompeius Magnus had got together a great force<a id="FA_41" href="#FN_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> in
a short time, contrary to the expectations of everyone,
with the intention of avenging his father’s
death, and, if possible, of retrieving his father’s
defeat. Octavius, left behind in Rome, in the first
place gave his attention to gaining as much physical
strength as possible, and soon he was sufficiently
robust. Then he set out from home toward the army,
according to his uncle’s instructions (for that is
what he called him). Many were eager to accompany
him on account of his great promise but he rejected
them all, even his mother herself, and selecting the
speediest and strongest of his servants he hastened
on his journey and with incredible despatch he covered
the long road and approached Caesar, who had already
completed the whole war in the space of seven months.<a id="FA_42" href="#FN_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">11.</span>When Octavius reached Tarraco it was hard to
believe that he had managed to arrive in so great a
tumult of war. Not finding Caesar there, he had to
endure more trouble and danger. He caught up
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Caesar in Spain near the city of Calpia.<a id="FA_43" href="#FN_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Caesar
embraced him as a son and welcomed him, for he had
left him at home, ill, and he now unexpectedly saw
him safe from both enemies and brigands. In fact,
he did not let him go from him, but he kept him at
his own quarters and mess. He commended his zeal
and intelligence<a id="FA_44" href="#FN_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> inasmuch as he was the first of
those who had set out from Rome to arrive. And he
made the point of asking him concerning many things
in the course of their conversation, for he was
anxious to make a trial of his understanding; and
finding that he was sagacious, intelligent, and concise
in his replies and that he always answered to
the point, his esteem and affection for him increased.
After this they had to sail for Carthago Nova, and
arrangements were made whereby Octavius embarked in
the same boat as Caesar, with five slaves, but, out
of affection, he took three of his companions aboard
in addition to the slaves, though he feared that
Caesar would be angry when he found this out. However,
the reverse was the case, for Caesar was pleased
in that Octavius was fond of his comrades and he commended
him because he always liked to have present
with him men who were observant and who tried to
attain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
to excellence; and because he was already giving no
little thought to gaining a good reputation at home.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">12.</span>Caesar duly arrived at Carthago Nova, intending
to meet with those who were in need of him. A great
many came to see him, some for the purpose of settling
any differences they might have with certain persons,
others because of matters of civil administration,
others in order to obtain the rewards for deeds of
courage which they had performed. Regarding these
matters he gave them audience. Many other officers
had congregated there also. The Saguntini came to
Octavius asking for assistance, for there were a number
of charges against them. He acted as their spokesman,
and speaking before Caesar skillfully secured
their release from the charges. He sent them home
delighted, singing his praises to everyone and calling
him their savior. Thereupon many people approached
him, asking for his patronage, and he proved of considerable
value to them. Some he relieved of the
charges brought against them, for others he secured
rewards, and he placed still others in offices of
state. His kindness, humanity, and the prudence he
had revealed at these gatherings were subjects of comment
to all. In fact, Caesar himself
cautiously....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span><a id="FA_45" href="#FN_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">13.</span>... of silver, according to the ancestral custom;<a id="FA_46" href="#FN_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
nor to associate with young fellows who drank freely,
nor to remain at banquets till nightfall, nor to dine
before the tenth hour, except at the house of Caesar
or Philippus or Marcellus,<a id="FA_47" href="#FN_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> his sister’s husband, a
man of sobriety and of the best Roman descent. Modesty,
which one might assume was fitting for one of that age
(for nature has assigned it an earlier place than the
other virtues) was apparent in his actions and continued
during his whole life. Therefore Caesar made
much of him and not, as some think, entirely because
of relationship. Some time before he had decided to
adopt him, but fearing that elated at the hope of such
good fortune, as those usually are who are brought up
in wealth, he might become forgetful of virtue and
depart from his accustomed mode of life, Caesar concealed
his intention but he adopted him as son in his
will<a id="FA_48" href="#FN_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> (for he had no male children of his own) and
made him residuary legatee of his entire estate, after
bequeathing one fourth of his property to friends and
townsmen, as was afterwards known.<a id="FA_49" href="#FN_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">14.</span>Octavius asked permission to go home to see his
mother, and when it was granted, he set out. When he
reached the Janiculan hill near Rome, a man who
claimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
to be the son of Caius Marius came with a large crowd
of people to meet him.<a id="FA_50" href="#FN_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> He had taken also some women
who were relatives of Caesar, for he was anxious to be
enrolled in the family, and they testified to his descent.
He did not succeed in persuading Atia at all,
nor her sister, to make any false statement concerning
their family; for the families of Caesar and Marius
were very close,<a id="FA_51" href="#FN_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> but this young man was really no
relative whatever. So then, he came up to the young
Caesar with a great multitude and tried to gain his
authority also for being enrolled in the family. The
citizens who accompanied him were also earnestly persuaded
that he was Marius’ son. Octavius was in quite
a quandary and began to consider what he should do.
It was a difficult thing to greet a stranger as a
relative, one whose origin he did not know, and for
whom his mother did not vouch; and on the other hand,
to repudiate the youth and the crowd of citizens with
him would be very difficult particularly for one so
modest as he. Accordingly, he quietly answered and
dismissed the fellow, saying that Caesar was the head
of their family, and the chief of the state and of the
whole Roman government. He should therefore go to
him and explain to him the kinship, and if he
convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Caesar, then both they and the other relations
would accede to his decision quite convinced; otherwise
there could be no ground for their connection with
him. In the meanwhile, until Caesar decided, he
should not come to Octavius nor ask for anything that
might be expected of a relative. Thus sensibly he
answered and everyone there commended him; nevertheless
the young fellow followed him all the way home.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">15.</span>When he arrived in Rome he lodged near the house
of Philippus and his mother and passed his time with
them, seldom leaving them, except at times when he
wished to invite some of his young friends to dine
with him; but that was not often. While he was in
the city, he was declared a patrician by the senate.<a id="FA_52" href="#FN_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Octavius lived soberly and in moderation; and his
friends knew of something else about him that was remarkable.
For an entire year at the very age at
which youths, particularly those of wealth, are most
wanton, he abstained from sexual gratification out of
regard for both his voice and his strength. (End of
the history of Nicolaus Damascenus and of the life
of the young Caesar. Concerning virtue and vice.)<a id="FA_53" href="#FN_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">16.</span>Octavius spent three months in Rome and then
came and sojourned here.<a id="FA_54" href="#FN_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> He was admired by
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
friends and companions, revered by everyone in the
city, and praised by his instructors.<a id="FA_55" href="#FN_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In the fourth
month of his stay, a freedman came from home, in excitement
and dismay, sent by his mother and carrying
a letter which said that Caesar had been killed in
the senate by Cassius and Brutus and their accomplices.
She asked her son to return to her as she did not
know what the outcome of affairs would be. She said
he must show himself a man now and consider what he
ought to do and put his plans in action, according to
fortune and opportunity. His mother’s letter made
all this clear, and the man who brought it gave a
similar report. He said he had been sent immediately
after Caesar’s murder, and he had wasted no time on
the way, so that hearing the news as quickly as possible,
Octavius would be able to make his plans accordingly.
He added that the relatives of the murdered
man were in great danger, and it was necessary to
consider first of all how this was to be avoided. The
group of murderers was not small, and they would drive
out and murder Caesar’s relatives.</p>

<p class="pt1">When they heard this they were greatly disturbed
(it was just about the time that they were going to
dinner). Speedily a report spread to those out
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
doors and through the whole city, revealing nothing
accurately, but only that some great calamity had
befallen. Then when the evening was fully come many
of the foremost Apollonians came up with torches,
asking with kind intent what the news was. After
taking counsel with his friends Octavius decided to
tell the most distinguished of them, but to send the
rabble away. He and his friends did so, and when the
crowd was with difficulty persuaded by the leaders to
leave, Octavius had the opportunity of taking counsel
with his friends (much of the night already having
been spent) as to what ought to be done and how he
should improve the situation. After thoroughly considering
the case, some of his friends advised him to
go and join the army in Macedonia; it had been sent
out for the Parthian War, and Marcus Acilius<a id="FA_56" href="#FN_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> was in
command of it. They advised him to take the army for
the sake of safety, to go to Rome, and to take vengeance
upon the murderers. The soldiers would be
hostile toward the murderers because they had been
fond of Caesar, and their sympathy would increase
when they saw the boy. But this seemed a difficult
course for a very young man, and too much for his
present youth and inexperience, especially since
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
disposition of the people toward him was not clear as
yet and many enemies were at hand. Hence this suggestion
was not adopted.</p>

<p class="pt1">Avengers of Caesar were expected to appear from
among those who in his lifetime had come upon good
fortune at his hands or who had received from him
power, riches, and valuable gifts, such as they had
not hoped for even in dreams. Octavius received advice
of various sorts from different people, as is
always the case in times when a situation is obscure
and unsettled, but he determined to postpone decision
in the whole matter until he could see those of his
friends who were preeminently mature and wise and
secure the aid of their counsel also. He decided
therefore to refrain from action, but to go to Rome,
and having first arrived in Italy, to find out what
had taken place after Caesar’s murder, and to take
counsel with the people there concerning the entire
affair.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">17.</span>His retinue then began preparations for the
voyage. Alexander<a id="FA_57" href="#FN_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> pleading his age and ill health,
returned to his home at Pergamum. The inhabitants
of Apollonia came in multitudes and for some time
affectionately begged Octavius to stay with
them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
saying that they would put the city to any use that
he wished, out of good will toward him and reverence
for the deceased.<a id="FA_58" href="#FN_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> They thought that it would be
better for him to await developments in a friendly
city, since so many enemies were abroad. However,
since he desired to participate in whatever was done,
and to avail himself of any opportunity for action,
he did not change his decision, but said that he must
set sail. Then he praised the Apollonians, and afterward
when he became master of Rome he conferred on
them autonomy and immunity and some other not inconsiderable
favors, and made it one of the most fortunate
of cities.<a id="FA_59" href="#FN_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> All the people in tears escorted
him at his departure, admiring his restraint and
wisdom that he had revealed in his sojourn there; and
at the same time they were sorry for his lot.</p>

<p class="pt1">There came to him from the army not a few from
the cavalry and infantry, both tribunes and centurions,
and many others for the sake of serving him, but some
for their own gain. Then they exhorted him to take
up arms and they promised that they would take the
field with him and persuade others also, in order to
avenge Caesar’s death. He commended them, but said
that he had no need of them at present; when, however,
he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
would call them to take vengeance, he asked that they
be ready; and they agreed to this.</p>

<p class="pt1">Octavius put out to sea on ships which were at
hand, though it was still quite perilously wintry,
and crossing the Ionian Sea, arrived at the nearest
promontory of Calabria, where the news regarding the
revolution at Rome had not yet been clearly announced
to the inhabitants. He came ashore here and started
on foot for Lupiae.<a id="FA_60" href="#FN_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> When he arrived there he met
people who had been in Rome when Caesar was buried;
and they told him, among other things, that he had
been named in the will as Caesar’s son, inheriting
three fourths of his property, the remaining share
having been set aside to pay the sum of seventy five
drachmae to each man in the city.<a id="FA_61" href="#FN_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> He had enjoined
Atia, the youth’s mother, to take charge of his
burial, but a great crowd had forced its way into
the forum and had there cremated the body and interred
the remains. They told Octavius that Brutus
and Cassius and the other murderers had taken possession
of the Capitol, and were obtaining, through the
promise of freedom, the slaves as allies. On the
first two days while Caesar’s friends were still
panic stricken<a id="FA_62" href="#FN_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> many men came and joined the
murderers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
but when colonists from the neighboring cities
(whom Caesar had furnished with grants and had established
in those cities) began to come in large numbers
and attach themselves to the followers of Lepidus, the
master of horse,<a id="FA_63" href="#FN_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and to those of Antonius, Caesar’s
colleague in the consulship,<a id="FA_64" href="#FN_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> who were promising to
avenge Caesar’s death, most of the conspirators’ group
dispersed. The conspirators being thus deserted gathered
some gladiators and others who were implacably
hostile to Caesar, or who had had a share in the plot.
A little later, all these came down from the Capitoline,
having received pledges of safety from Antonius
who now had a large force, but who for the present
had given up his plan to avenge Caesar’s murder.
(That was why they were allowed to leave Rome safely
and go to Antium.)<a id="TA_14"></a>
<a id="FA_65" href="#FN_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Even their houses were besieged
by the people, not under any leader, but the populace
itself was enraged on account of the murder of Caesar,
of whom they were fond, and especially when they had
seen his bloody garment and newly slain body brought
to burial when they had forced their way into the
forum and had there interred it.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">18.</span>When Octavius heard this he was moved to tears
and grief because of his memory and affection
for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
the man, and his sorrow stirred anew. Then he stopped
and waited for other letters from his mother and friends
in Rome, although he did not disbelieve those who had
reported the events, for he saw no reason why they
should fabricate any falsehood. After this he set
sail for Brundisium, for he had now learned that none
of his enemies were there, though previously he had
been suspicious lest the city might be held by some
of them, and consequently he had not recklessly approached
it directly from the other shore.<a id="FA_66" href="#FN_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> There
arrived from his mother also a letter in which was
written an urgent request for him to return to her
and the whole household as soon as possible, so that
no treachery should come upon him from without, seeing
that he had been designated Caesar’s son. It
bore out the earlier news, and said that the whole
populace was aroused against Brutus and Cassius and
their party, and was greatly vexed at what they had
done. His <a id="TA_21" href="#TN_21">step-father</a> Philippus
sent him a letter asking him not to take steps to secure Caesar’s
bequest but even to retain his own name<a id="FA_67" href="#FN_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> because of
what had happened to Caesar and to live free from
politics and in safety. Octavius knew that this advice
was given with kind intent, but he thought
differently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
as he already had his mind on great things
and he was full of confidence; he therefore took upon
himself the toil and danger and the enmity of men
whom he did not care to please. Nor did he propose
to cede to anyone a name or a rule so great as his,
particularly with the state on his side and calling
him to come into his father’s honors;<a id="FA_68" href="#FN_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and very
rightly, since both naturally and by law the office
belonged to him, for he was the nearest relative and
had been adopted as son by Caesar himself, and he
felt that to follow the matter up and avenge his
death was the proper course to pursue. This is what
he thought, and he wrote and so answered Philippus,
though he did not succeed in convincing him. His
mother Atia when she saw how glorious his fortune
was and the extent of the empire rejoiced that it
devolved upon her own son; but on the other hand
knowing that the undertaking was full of fear and
danger, and having seen what had happened to her
uncle Caesar, she was not very enthusiastic; so it
looked as though she was between the view of her husband
Philippus and that of her son. Hence she felt
many cares, now anxious when she enumerated all the
dangers awaiting one striving for supreme power,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
now elated when she thought of the extent of that
power and honor. Therefore she did not dare to dissuade
her son from attempting the great deed and
effecting a just requital, but still she did not venture
to urge him on, because fortune seemed somewhat
obscure.<a id="FA_69" href="#FN_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> She permitted his use of the name Caesar
and in fact was the first to assent. Octavian, having
made inquiry as to what all his friends thought
about this also, without delay accepted both the name
and the adoption, with good fortune and favorable
omen.<a id="FA_70" href="#FN_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p class="pt1">This was the beginning of good both for himself
and all mankind, but especially for the state and the
entire Roman people. He sent immediately to Asia
for the money and means<a id="FA_71" href="#FN_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> that Caesar had previously
despatched for the Parthian War, and when he received
it along with a year’s tribute from the people of
Asia, contenting himself with the position that had
belonged to Caesar<a id="FA_72" href="#FN_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> he turned the public property
over to the state treasury. At that time, too, some
of his friends urged him as they had at Apollonia to
go to Caesar’s colonies and to levy an army,<a id="FA_73" href="#FN_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> inducing
the men to join an expedition on his behalf by
employing the prestige of the great name of
Caesar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span><a id="FA_74" href="#FN_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
They declared that the soldiers would gladly follow
the leadership of Caesar’s son and would do everything
for him; for there persisted among them a wonderful
loyalty and good will toward Caesar and a memory of
what they had accomplished with him in his lifetime,
and they desired under the auspices of Caesar’s name
to win the power which they had formerly bestowed
upon Caesar. However, the opportunity for this did
not seem to be at hand. He therefore turned his attention
toward seeking legally, through a senatorial
decree, the dignity his father had held;<a id="FA_75" href="#FN_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and he
was careful not to acquire the reputation of being
one who was ambitious and not a law-abiding man.
Accordingly, he listened especially to the eldest of
his friends and those of the greatest experience,
and set out from Brundisium for Rome.<a id="FA_76" href="#FN_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">19.</span>From this point my narrative will investigate
the manner in which the assassins formed their conspiracy
against Caesar and how they worked out the
whole affair, and what happened afterward when the
whole state was shaken. Accordingly, I shall in the
first place rehearse the circumstances of the plot
itself, its reasons, and its final momentous outcome.
In the next place I shall speak of Octavian on
whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
account this narrative was undertaken; how he came
into power, and how, after he had taken his predecessor’s
place, he employed himself in deeds of peace
and war.</p>

<p class="pt1">At first a few men started the conspiracy,<a id="FA_77" href="#FN_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
but afterwards many took part, more than are remembered
to have taken part in any earlier plot against
a commander. They say that there were more than
eighty who had a share in it.<a id="FA_78" href="#FN_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Among those who had
the most influence were: Decimus Brutus, a particular
friend of Caesar, Caius Cassius, and Marcus Brutus,
second to none in the estimation of the Romans at
that time. All these were formerly members of the
opposite faction, and had tried to further Pompeius’
interests,<a id="FA_79" href="#FN_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> but when he was defeated, they came under
Caesar’s jurisdiction and lived quietly for the time
being; but although Caesar tried to win them over
individually by kindly treatment, they never abandoned
their hope of doing him harm.<a id="FA_80" href="#FN_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> He on his part was
naturally without grudge against the beaten party,
because of a certain leniency of disposition,<a id="FA_81" href="#FN_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> but
they, using to their own advantage his lack of suspicion,
by seductive words and pretence of deeds
treated him in such a way as to more readily
escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
detection in their plot. There were various reasons
which affected each and all of them and impelled them
to lay hands on the man. Some of them had hopes of
becoming leaders themselves in his place if he were
put out of the way; others were angered over what had
happened to them in the war, embittered over the loss
of their relatives, property, or offices of state.
They concealed the fact that they were angry, and
made the pretense of something more seemly, saying
that they were displeased at the rule of a single
man and that they were striving for a republican form
of government. Different people had different reasons,
all brought together by whatever pretext they happened
upon.</p>

<p class="pt1">At first the ringleaders conspired; then many
more joined, some of their own accord because of personal
grievances, some because they had been associated
with the others and wished to show plainly the good
faith in their <a id="TA_22" href="#TN_22">long-standing</a> friendship, and accordingly
became their associates. There were some who were
of neither of these types, but who had agreed because
of the worth of the others, and who resented the
power of one man after the long-standing republican
constitution. They were very glad not to start
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
affair themselves, but were willing to join such company
when someone else had initiated proceedings, not
even hesitating to pay the penalty if need be. The
reputation which had long been attached to the Brutus
family was very influential in causing the uprising,
for Brutus’ ancestors had overthrown the kings who
ruled from the time of Romulus, and they had first
established republican government in Rome.<a id="FA_82" href="#FN_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Moreover,
men who had been friends of Caesar were no
longer similarly well disposed toward him when they
saw people who were previously his enemies saved by
him and given honors equal to their own. In fact,
even these others were not particularly well disposed
toward him,<a id="FA_83" href="#FN_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> for their ancient grudges took precedence
over gratitude and made them forgetful of their
good fortune in being saved, while, when they remembered
the good things they had lost in being defeated,
they were provoked. Many also hated him because they
had been saved by him although he had been irreproachable
in his behavior toward them in every respect;
but nevertheless, the very thought of receiving as a
favor the benefits which as victors they would readily
have enjoyed, annoyed them very much.</p>

<p class="pt1">Then there was another class of men, namely
those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
who had served with him, whether as officers or privates,
and who did not get a share of glory. They
asserted that prisoners of war were enrolled among
the veteran forces and that they received identical
pay. Accordingly, his friends were incensed at being
rated as equal to those whom they themselves had taken
prisoners, and indeed they were even outranked by
some of them. To many, also, the fact that they benefitted
at his hands, both by gifts of property and by
appointments to offices, was a special source of
grievance, since he alone was able to bestow such
benefits, and everyone else was ignored as of no importance.
When he became exalted through many notable
victories (which was fair enough) and began to think
himself super human<a id="FA_84" href="#FN_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> the common people worshipped
him, but he began to be obnoxious to the optimates
and to those who were trying to obtain a share in the
government. And so, every kind of man combined against
him: great and small, friend and foe, military and
political, every one of whom put forward his own particular
pretext for the matter in hand, and as a result
of his own complaints each lent a ready ear to the
accusations of the others. They all confirmed each
other in their conspiracy and they furnished as
surety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span><a id="FA_85" href="#FN_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
to one another the grievances which they held severally
in private against him. Hence, though the number
of conspirators became so great, no one dared to give
information of the fact. Some say, however, that a
little before his death, Caesar received a note in
which warning of the plot was given, and that he was
murdered with it in his hands before he had a chance
to read it, and that it was found among other notes
after his death.<a id="FA_86" href="#FN_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">20.</span>However, all this became known subsequently. At
that time some wished to gratify him by voting him
one honor after another, while others treacherously
included extravagant honors, and published them, so
that he might become an object of envy and suspicion
to all.<a id="FA_87" href="#FN_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Caesar was of guileless disposition and was
unskilled in political practices by reason of his
foreign campaigns, so that he was easily taken in by
these people, supposing, naturally enough, that their
commendations came rather from men who admired him
than from men who were plotting against him.<a id="FA_88" href="#FN_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p class="pt1">To those who were in authority this measure was
especially displeasing: that the people were now rendered
powerless to make appointments to office, and
that Caesar was given the right of investure to
bestow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
upon whomsoever he pleased. An ordinance voted not
long before provided this.<a id="FA_89" href="#FN_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Furthermore, all sorts
of rumors were being bandied about in the crowd,
some telling one story, others another. Some said
that he had decided to establish a capital of the
whole empire in Egypt, and that Queen Cleopatra had
lain with him and borne him a son, named Cyrus, there.
This he himself refuted in his will as false.<a id="FA_90" href="#FN_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
Others said that he was going to do the same thing
at Troy, on account of his ancient connection with
the Trojan race.<a id="FA_91" href="#FN_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p class="pt1">Something else, such as it was, took place
which especially stirred the conspirators against
him. There was a golden statue of him which had
been erected on the rostra<a id="FA_92" href="#FN_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> by vote of the people.
A diadem appeared on it, encircling the head, whereupon
the Romans became very suspicious, supposing
that it was a symbol of servitude. Two of the
tribunes, Lucius and Caius,<a id="FA_93" href="#FN_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> came up and ordered
one of their subordinates to climb up, take it down,
and throw it away. When Caesar discovered what had
happened, he convened the senate in the temple of
Concordia<a id="FA_94" href="#FN_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and arraigned the tribunes, asserting
that they themselves had secretly placed the
diadem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
on the statue, so that they might have a chance to
insult him openly and thus get credit for doing a
brave deed by dishonoring the statue, caring nothing
either for him or for the senate. He continued
that their action was one which indicated a more
serious resolution and plot: if somehow they might
slander him to the people as a seeker after unconstitutional
power, and thus (themselves stirring up
an insurrection) to slay him. After this address,
with the concurrence of the senate he banished them.<a id="FA_95" href="#FN_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Accordingly, they went off into exile and other
tribunes were appointed in their place. Then the
people clamored that he become king and they shouted
that there should be no longer any delay in crowning
him as such, for Fortune had already crowned him.
But Caesar declared that although he would grant the
people everything because of their good will toward
him, he would never allow this step; and he asked
their indulgence for contradicting their wishes in
preserving the old form of government, saying that
he preferred to hold the office of consul in accordance
with the law to being king illegally.<a id="FA_96" href="#FN_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">21.</span>Such was the people’s talk at that time. Later,
in the course of the winter, a festival was held
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
Rome, called Lupercalia,<a id="FA_97" href="#FN_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> in which old and young men
together take part in a procession, naked except for
a girdle, and anointed, railing at those whom they
meet and striking them with pieces of goat’s hide.
When this festival came on Marcus Antonius was chosen
director. He proceeded through the forum, as was the
custom, and the rest of the throng followed him.
Caesar was sitting in a golden chair on the Rostra,
wearing a purple toga. At first Licinius<a id="FA_98" href="#FN_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> advanced
toward him carrying a laurel wreath, though inside
it a diadem was plainly visible. He mounted up,
pushed up by his colleagues (for the place from which
Caesar was accustomed to address the assembly was
high), and set the diadem down before Caesar’s feet.
Amid the cheers of the crowd he placed it on Caesar’s
head. Thereupon Caesar called Lepidus, the master
of horse, to ward him off, but Lepidus hesitated.<a id="FA_99" href="#FN_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
In the meanwhile Cassius Longinus, one of the conspirators,
pretending to be really well disposed
toward Caesar so that he might the more readily escape
suspicion, hurriedly removed the diadem and
placed it in Caesar’s lap. Publius Casca was also
with him.<a id="FA_100" href="#FN_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> While Caesar kept rejecting it, and
among the shouts of the people, Antonius
suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
rushed up, naked and anointed, just as he was in the
procession, and placed it on his head. But Caesar
snatched it off, and threw it into the crowd. Those
who were standing at some distance applauded this
action, but those who were near at hand clamored
that he should accept it and not repel the people’s
favor. Various individuals held different views of
the matter. Some were angry, thinking it an indication
of power out of place in a democracy; others,
thinking to court favor, approved; still others
spread the report that Antonius had acted as he did
not without Caesar’s connivance. There were many
who were quite willing that Caesar be made king openly.
All sorts of talk began to go through the crowd.
When Antonius crowned Caesar a second time, the people
shouted in chorus, ‘Hail, King;’<a id="FA_101" href="#FN_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> but Caesar still
refusing the crown, ordered it to be taken to the
temple of Capitoline Jupiter, saying that it was
more appropriate there. Again the same people applauded
as before. There is told another story, that
Antonius acted thus wishing to ingratiate himself
with Caesar, and at the same time was cherishing the
hope of being adopted as his son.<a id="FA_102" href="#FN_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Finally, he embraced
Caesar and gave the crown to some of the
men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
standing near to place it on the head of the statue
of Caesar which was near by. This they did. Of all
the occurrences of that time this was not the least
influential in hastening the action of the conspirators,
for it proved to their very eyes the truth of
the suspicions they entertained.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">22.</span>Not long after this,<a id="FA_103" href="#FN_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> the praetor Cinna propitiated
Caesar to the extent of securing a decree
which allowed the exiled tribunes to return. Though
in accordance with the wish of the people they were
not to resume their office, but to remain private
citizens, yet not excluded from public affairs.
Caesar did not prevent their recall, so they returned.
Caesar called the annual comitia (for he had the
authority of a decree to do so)<a id="FA_104" href="#FN_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and appointed
Vibius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius as consuls for the
ensuing year; for the year after that, Decimus Brutus,
one of the conspirators, and Munatius Plancus. Directly
after this, another thing happened that greatly
aroused the conspirators. Caesar was having a large,
handsome forum laid out in Rome, and he had called
together the artisans and was letting the contracts
for its construction. In the meanwhile up came a
procession of Roman nobles, to confer the
honors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
which had just been voted him by common consent. In
the lead was the consul (the one who was Caesar’s
colleague at that time),<a id="FA_105" href="#FN_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and he carried the decree
with him. In front of him were lictors, keeping the
crowd back on either side. With the consul came the
praetors, tribunes, quaestors, and all the other
officials. Next came the senate in orderly formation,
and then a multitude of enormous size—never so large.
The dignity of the nobles was awe-inspiring—they
were entrusted with the rule of the whole empire, and
yet looked with admiration on another as if he were
still greater. Caesar was seated<a id="FA_106" href="#FN_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> while they advanced
and because he was conversing with men standing
to one side, he did not turn his head toward the
approaching procession or pay any attention to it,
but continued to prosecute the business which he had
on hand, until one of his friends, nearby, said,
‘Look at these people coming up in front of you.’
Then Caesar laid down his papers and turned around
and listened to what they had come to say. Now
among their number were<a id="FA_107" href="#FN_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> the conspirators, who filled
the others with ill-will toward him, though the
others were already offended at him because of this
incident.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p class="pt1">Then those also were excited who wished to lay
hands on him not to recover liberty but to destroy
the entire extant system; they were looking for an
opportunity to overcome one who seemed to be absolutely
invincible. For, although he had participated
up to this time in three hundred and two battles in
both Asia and Europe, it appeared that he had never
been worsted. Since, however, he frequently came
out by himself and appeared before them, the hope
arose that he could be taken by treachery. They tried
to bring about, somehow, the dismissal of his body
guard by flattering him when they addressed him, saying
that he ought to be considered sacred in the eyes
of all and be called ‘pater patriae’;<a id="FA_108" href="#FN_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and by proposing
decrees to that effect in the hope that he
would be thus misled and actually trust to their affection,
and that he would dismiss his spearmen in
the belief that he was guarded by the good will of
everyone. This actually came to pass, and made their
task far easier.<a id="FA_109" href="#FN_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">23.</span>The conspirators never met to make their plans
in the open, but in secret, a few at a time in each
other’s houses. As was natural, many plans were proposed
and set in motion by them as they
considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
how and when they should commit the awful deed. Some
proposed to attack him while on his way through the
‘Via sacra’, for he often walked there;<a id="FA_110" href="#FN_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> others, at
the time of the comitia, when he had to cross a certain
bridge<a id="FA_111" href="#FN_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> to hold the election of magistrates in
the field before the city. They would so divide
their duties by lot that some should jostle him off
the bridge and the others should rush upon him and
slay him. Others proposed that he be attacked when
the gladiatorial shows were held<a id="FA_112" href="#FN_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> (they were near
at hand), for then, because of these contests no
suspicion would be aroused in the sight of men armed
for the deed. The majority urged that he be killed
during the session of the senate, for then he was
likely to be alone. There was no admittance to non-members,
and many of the senators were conspirators,
and carried swords under their togas. This plan was
adopted.<a id="FA_113" href="#FN_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Fortune had a part in this by causing
Caesar himself to set a certain day on which the
members of the senate were to assemble to consider
certain motions which he wished to introduce. When
the appointed day came the conspirators assembled,
prepared in all respects. They met in the portico
of Pompeius’ theatre, where they sometimes
gathered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Thus the divinity showed the vanity of man’s estate—how
very unstable it is, and subject to the vagaries
of fortune—for Caesar was brought to the house of
his enemy, there to lie, a corpse, before the statue
of one whom, now dead, he had defeated when he was
alive. And fate becomes a still stronger force if
indeed one acknowledges her part in these things: on
that day his friends, drawing conclusions from certain
auguries, tried to prevent him from going to the
senate room, as did also his physicians on account of
vertigoes to which he was sometimes subject, and from
which he was at that time suffering; and especially
his wife Calpurnia, who was terrified by a dream that
night. She clung to him and said that she would not
let him go out that day. But Brutus, one of the conspirators,
though he was at that time thought to be
one of his most intimate friends, came up to him and
said: ‘What do you say, Caesar? Are you going to pay
any attention to a woman’s dreams and foolish men’s
omens, a man such as you? Are you going to insult
the senate which has honored you and which you yourself
convened, by not going out? No; if you take my
advice you will dismiss from your mind the dreams of
these people and go, for the senate has been
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
session since morning, and is awaiting you.’ He was
persuaded and went out.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">24.</span>Meanwhile the assassins were making ready, some
of them stationing themselves beside his chair, others
in front of it, others behind it. The augurs brought
forward the victims for him to make his final sacrifice
before his entry into the senate room. It was manifest
that the omens were unfavorable. The augurs substituted
one animal after another in the attempt to secure
a more auspicious forecast. Finally they said
that the indications from the gods were unfavorable
and that there was plainly some sort of curse hiding
in the victims. In disgust, Caesar turned away toward
the setting sun,<a id="FA_114" href="#FN_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and the augurs interpreted this
action still more unfavorably. The assassins were on
hand and were pleased at all this. Caesar’s friends
begged that he postpone the present session on account
of what the soothsayers had said; and for his part,
he was just giving the order<a id="FA_115" href="#FN_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> to do this, but suddenly
the attendants came to summon him, saying that the
senate had a quorum. Then Caesar cast a look toward
his friends. And Brutus approached him again and
said: ‘Come, sir, turn your back on these people’s
nonsense and do not postpone the business that
deserves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the attention of Caesar and of the great empire but
consider your own worth a favorable omen.’ Thus persuading
him, he at the same time took him by the
hand and led him in, for the senate-chamber was near
by. Caesar followed in silence. When he came in
and the senate saw him, the members rose out of
respect to him. Those who intended to lay hands on
him were all about him. The first to come to him
was Tullius Cimber, whose brother Caesar had exiled,
and stepping forward as though to make an urgent
appeal on behalf of his brother, he seized Caesar’s
toga, seeming to act rather boldly for a suppliant,<a id="FA_116" href="#FN_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
and thus prevented him from standing up and using his
hands if he so wished. Caesar was very angry, but
the men held to their purpose and all suddenly bared
their daggers and rushed upon him. First Servilius
Casca stabbed him on the left shoulder a little
above the collar bone, at which he had aimed but
missed through nervousness. Caesar sprang up to
defend himself against him, and Casca called to his
brother, speaking in Greek in his excitement. The
latter obeyed him and drove his sword into Caesar’s
side. A moment before Cassius had struck him obliquely
across the face. Decimus Brutus struck him
through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
the thigh. Cassius Longinus was eager to give another
stroke, but he missed and struck Marcus Brutus on the
hand. Minucius, too, made a lunge at Caesar but he
struck Rubrius on the thigh. It looked as if they
were fighting over Caesar. He fell, under many wounds,
before the statue of Pompey, and there was not one of
them but struck him as he lay lifeless, to show that
each of them had had a share in the deed, until he
had received thirty-five wounds, and breathed his
last.<a id="FA_117" href="#FN_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">25.</span>A tremendous uproar arose from those who had
no knowledge of the plot and who were rushing terror-stricken
from the senate house, thinking that the
same awful thing was going to happen to themselves
also; and from those of Caesar’s associates who were
outside and who thought that the whole senate was
involved and that a large army was on hand for the
purpose; and from those who, ignorant of the affair,
were terrified and thrown into confusion from the
suddenness of the noise and from what burst upon
their view (for all at once the assassins, with
bloody daggers in their hands...).<a id="FA_118" href="#FN_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The whole place
was full of people running and shouting. There was
a crowd, too, in the theatre, which got up
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
rushed out in disorder (there happened to be a gladiatorial
exhibition in progress) knowing nothing
definite of what had happened but frightened by the
shouting all about them. Some said that the senate
was being slaughtered by gladiators, others that
Caesar had been murdered and that his army had started
to pillage the city; some got one impression,
others another. There was nothing clear to be heard,
for there was a continuous tumult until the people
saw the assassins and Marcus Brutus trying to stop
the outcry and exhorting<a id="FA_119" href="#FN_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> the people to be of good
courage, for that no evil had taken place. The sum
and substance of his words (as the rest of the
assassins also loudly boasted) was that they had
slain a tyrant. It was proposed by some of the conspirators
that they ought to put out of the way still
others who were likely to oppose them and again try
to gain control. They say that Marcus Brutus restrained
them,<a id="FA_120" href="#FN_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
declaring that it was not right to
kill, for the sake of vague suspicion, people against
whom there was no clear charge; and this view prevailed.
Then rushing forth the assassins fled in
haste through the <a id="TA_23" href="#TN_23">forum</a>
up to the Capitoline, carrying
their swords bare and shouting that they
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
acted in behalf of common freedom. A great crowd
of gladiators and slaves, who had been prepared for
the purpose, followed them. There was much running
in the streets and through the forum, now that the
news that Caesar had been murdered became known to
the throng. The city looked as if it had been occupied
by an enemy. After the conspirators had ascended the
Capitoline, they distributed themselves in a circle
about the place and mounted guard, fearing that
Caesar’s soldiers would attack them.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">26.</span>The body of Caesar lay just where it fell, ignominiously
stained with blood—a man who had advanced
westward as far as Britain and the Ocean, and
who had intended to advance eastward against the
realms of the Parthians and Indi,<a id="FA_121" href="#FN_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> so that, with
them also subdued, an empire of all land and sea
might be brought under the power of a single head.
There he lay, no one daring to remain to remove the
body. Those of his friends who had been present had
run away, and those who were away remained hidden
in their houses, or else changed their clothing and
went out into the country districts nearby. Not one
of his many friends stood by him, either while he
was being slaughtered or afterward, except
Calvisius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Sabinus and Censorinus,<a id="FA_122" href="#FN_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> but these also, though they
offered some slight opposition when Brutus and Cassius
and their followers made their attack, had to flee
because of the greater number of their opponents.
All the others looked out for themselves and some
even acquiesced in what had occurred. They say that
one of them thus addressed the body: ‘Enough of
truckling to a tyrant.’ A little later, three slaves,<a id="FA_123" href="#FN_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
who were nearby, placed the body on a litter and
carried it home through the forum, showing, where
the covering was drawn back on each side, the hands
hanging limp and the wounds on the face. Then no
one refrained from tears, seeing him who had lately
been honored like a god. Much weeping and lamentation
accompanied them from either side, from mourners
on the roofs, in the streets, and in the vestibules.
When they approached his house, a far greater wailing
met their ears, for his wife rushed out with a
number of women and servants, calling on her husband
and bewailing her lot in that she had in vain counseled
him not to go out on that day. But he had met
with a fate far worse than she ever expected.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">26 b.</span>These were now preparing for his burial, but
the assassins had secured a number of
gladiators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
some time previous to the deed when they were about
to attack him and had placed them under arms, between
the senate house and the theatre in Pompeius’ arcade.
Decimus Brutus had got them ready under the pretext
that he wished to seize one of the gladiators who
were assembling in that theatre, a man whom he had
previously hired. (The contests were taking place
at that time,<a id="FA_124" href="#FN_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and as he was going to conduct some
himself, he pretended that he was jealous of the
present exhibitor.) As a matter of fact, this preparation
was more with reference to the assassination,
so that, in case any resistance should be offered by
Caesar’s guards,<a id="FA_125" href="#FN_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> the conspirators should have assistance
at hand. With these gladiators and an additional
throng of slaves they descended from the
Capitoline. Calling together the people, they decided
to test them and the magistrates, finding out
how they were regarded by them; whether they were
looked upon as having ended a tyranny or as murderers.
...<a id="FA_126" href="#FN_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> that still greater ills were likely to burst
forth in consequence of the late deed; for the action
had taken place with no inconsiderable forethought
and preparation on the part of those who accomplished
it, and on the part of those against whom the
plot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
was laid; and that there was a considerable number
of Caesar’s auxiliary troops and important commanders
still left, who would take over the task of carrying
out his plans. There was profound silence then because
of the unusual nature of the situation, for
men’s minds were confused, everyone watching eagerly
to see what bold move might first be made in such a
crisis, and be the beginning of a revolution. Meanwhile
since the people were quietly awaiting the consequences,
Marcus Brutus (honored throughout his whole
life because of his discretion and the renown of his
ancestors and the fairness which he was supposed to
have) made the following speech.<a id="FA_127" href="#FN_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> (See my work:
‘Concerning Public Speeches.’)</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">27.</span>After this harangue the conspirators withdrew
again to the Capitoline and took council<a id="FA_128" href="#FN_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> as to
what ought to be done under the present circumstances.
They decided to send envoys to Lepidus and Antonius
to persuade them to come to them in the temple<a id="FA_129" href="#FN_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and
there confer with them in planning the future of the
state; and to promise them that everything which
they possessed from Caesar’s hands would be considered
as authorized gifts, so that there would be no cause
for dissent on these grounds.<a id="FA_130" href="#FN_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> When the
envoys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
arrived Antonius and Lepidus said that they would
answer on the following day. These things were done
in the late evening, and a greater confusion laid
hold on the city. Everyone saw to his own property,
deserting the public interests, for they feared sudden
plots and attacks, seeing that the leaders were
encamped under arms in opposition to each other; nor
was it yet clear to them who would gain complete control.
When night came on they dispersed. On the
following day the consul Antonius was under arms;
and Lepidus,<a id="FA_131" href="#FN_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> having collected a considerable force
of auxiliaries proceeded through the middle of the
forum, having decided to avenge Caesar. When those
who had previously been in doubt saw this, they
joined Antonius and Lepidus, with their respective
retinues under arms, and the result was an army of
considerable size. There were some who acted thus
through fear, not wishing to seem too delighted at
Caesar’s death, and at the same time looking to
their future interests by joining the consuls.</p>

<p class="pt1">Many messages were sent to those who had benefitted
at Caesar’s hands (whether through grants of
dwelling places in cities, through grants of land,
or allotments of money) saying that everything
would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
be changed unless some strenuous efforts were exerted
by them as well. Then his friends received many
mournful entreaties, reminding those especially who
had once taken the field with him how he had suffered
death abandoned by his friends, great as he was.
Accordingly, many joined the consuls out of compassion
and friendship, finding a chance for private gain as
well as what would result from a revolution,<a id="FA_132" href="#FN_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> especially
since the course of their opponents seemed
to lack vigor and was not what they previously expected
it to be when they believed that they had a stronger
force. Now it was openly said that Caesar must be
avenged, and that this was the only thing to do, and
that his death must not go unpunished. Gathering
into groups they expressed various views, some suggesting
one course, others another.</p>

<p class="pt1">However, those who advocated a republican form
of government were gratified at the whole change,
and only blamed Caesar’s murderers because they had
not done away with more of the people who were at
that time viewed with suspicion, and thus brought
about a real liberty; for those who were still left
would be likely to give considerable trouble. There
were also men who had a reputation for greater
foresight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
and who had gained knowledge from experience
with what had happened before in Sulla’s time; they
cautioned one another to keep to a middle course,
for at the time of Sulla those who were thought to
have been destroyed, suddenly took fresh courage and
drove out their late conquerors. They declared that
Caesar would give his murderers and their companions
much trouble, even though he was dead, since here
was a large force threatening them, with energetic
men in charge of it.</p>

<p class="pt1">Antonius and his associates before preparing
for action sent a legation to parley with the forces
on the Capitoline, but later, emboldened by the amount
of their arms and the number of their men, they felt
justified in taking full charge of the government,
and ending the disturbance in the city. First of all
they took council (having asked their friends to be
present) how they ought to act toward the assassins.
Lepidus proposed that they should fight them and
avenge Caesar.<a id="FA_133" href="#FN_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Hirtius thought that they should
discuss the matter with them and come to friendly
terms. Someone else,<a id="FA_134" href="#FN_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> supporting Lepidus, expressed
the opposite opinion, saying that it would be sacrilegious
to pass by the murder of Caesar
unavenged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and furthermore, it would not be safe for all those
who had been his friends; ‘for even if the murderers
are inactive now, yet as soon as they get more power,
they will go still further.’ Antonius favored the
proposal of Hirtius, and voted to save them. There
were others who urged that they be dismissed from
the city under truce.<a id="FA_135" href="#FN_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">28.</span>After the great Caesar’s death and burial, his
friends counselled Octavian to cultivate Antonius’
friendship, and put him in charge of his interests....<a id="FA_136" href="#FN_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
And though there were many other contributory
causes toward disagreement between them, he<a id="FA_137" href="#FN_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> seemed
the more to incite enmity between them, for he was
at odds with Octavian, and a partisan of Antonius.
Octavian, however, in no wise frightened, because
of his high spirit, gave some exhibitions on the
occasion of the festival of Venus Genetrix which his
father had established. He again<a id="FA_138" href="#FN_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> approached
Antonius with a number of his friends, requesting
that permission be given for the throne and wreath
to be set up in his father’s honor. Antonius made
the same threat as before, if he did not drop that
proposal and keep quiet. Octavian withdrew and
made no opposition to the veto of the consul.
When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
he entered the theatre, however, the people applauded
him loudly, and his father’s soldiers, angered because
he had been prevented from paying tribute to the
honored memory of his father, gave him, as a mark of
their approval, one round of applause after another
all through the performance. Then he counted out for
the people their allotted money, and that secured
him their especial good will.<a id="FA_139" href="#FN_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p class="pt1">From that day Antonius was manifestly still more
ill disposed toward Octavian who stood in the way of
the people’s zeal for him. Octavian saw (what had
become very plain to him from the present situation)
that he was in need of political authority. He also
saw that the consuls,<a id="FA_140" href="#FN_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> secure in much power, were
openly resisting him and appropriating still more
power for themselves. Even the city treasury, which
his father had filled with funds, they had emptied
within two months<a id="FA_141" href="#FN_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> after Caesar’s death, wasting
money in large lots on any excuse that offered in
the general confusion; and furthermore they were on
good terms with the assassins.<a id="FA_142" href="#FN_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> So Octavian was
the only one left to avenge his father, for Antonius
let the whole matter pass, and was even in favor of
an amnesty for the assassins. A number of
men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
indeed, joined Octavian, but many joined Antonius
and Dolabella also. There were others who, from a
middle ground, tried to foment enmity between them,
and in doing so....<a id="FA_143" href="#FN_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The chief of these were the
following men: Publius, Vibius, Lucius, and especially
Cicero.<a id="FA_144" href="#FN_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Octavian was not ignorant of the reason
why they associated themselves with him, trying to
provoke him against Antonius, but he did not repel
them, for he wished to have their assistance and a
more powerful guard thrown around him, though he
was aware that each of these men was very little
concerned over public interests but that they were
looking about for an opportunity to acquire public
office and supreme power. To their mind, the man
who had previously enjoyed that power was out of
the way, and Octavian was altogether too young and
not likely to hold out against so great a tumult,
with one man looking out for one thing, another for
another, and all of them seizing what they could
for their own gain. For with all attention to public
welfare put away, and with the foremost citizens
separated into many factions, and everyone trying
to encompass all the power for himself, or at least
as much of it as could be detached, the rule
showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
many strange aspects.</p>

<p class="pt1">Lepidus, who had broken off a part of Caesar’s
army and who was trying to seize the command himself,
was in nearer Spain; he also held the part of Gaul
which borders on the upper sea.<a id="FA_145" href="#FN_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Gallia Comata
Lucius Munatius Plancus, the consul elect, held with
another army.<a id="FA_146" href="#FN_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Further Spain was in charge of
Gaius Asinius, with another army.<a id="FA_147" href="#FN_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Decimus Brutus
held Cisalpine Gaul<a id="FA_148" href="#FN_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> with two legions, against whom
Antonius was just preparing to march. Gaius Brutus<a id="FA_149" href="#FN_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
laid claim to Macedonia,<a id="FA_150" href="#FN_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and was just about to
cross over to that place from Italy; Cassius Longinus
laid claim to Syria, though he had been appointed
praetor for Illyria.<a id="FA_151" href="#FN_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> So many were the armies
that had been assembled at that time, so many the
commanders in charge, each of whom was trying to get
complete power into his own hands without consideration
of law and justice, every matter being decided
according to the amount of force that was available
for application in each case. Octavian alone, to
whom all the power had justly been bequeathed,<a id="FA_152" href="#FN_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
in accordance with the authority of him who had obtained
it in the first instance, and because of his
relationship to him, was without any share of
authority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
whatever, and he was buffeted between the political
envy and greed of men who were lying in wait to
attack him and seize the supreme command. Divine
providence finally ordered these things aright. But
for the present fearing for his life, knowing
Antonius’ attitude toward him and yet quite unable
to change it, Octavian remained at home and awaited
his opportunity.</p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">29.</span>The first move in the city came from his father’s
soldiers,<a id="FA_153" href="#FN_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> who resented Antonius’ contempt for them.
At first they discussed their own forgetfulness of
Caesar in allowing his son to be thus insulted, that
son for whom they all ought to act as guardians if
they were to take any account of what was just and
righteous. Then gathering in a great company and
reproaching themselves still more bitterly they set
out for Antonius’ house (for he also was relying on
them) and made some plain statements to him: that
he ought to treat Octavian more fairly and keep in
mind his father’s instructions; that it was their
sacred duty not to overlook these, but to carry out
even the details of his memoranda, not to mention
supporting the man he had named as his son and successor;
that they saw that to Antonius and
Octavian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
a reconciliation would be most advantageous at the
present time because of the multitude of foes pressing
on from every side. After this speech Antonius
in order not to seem to be opposing their endeavor,
for he happened to be really in need of their services,<a id="FA_154" href="#FN_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
said that he approved of and desired that
very course, if only Octavian would also act with
moderation and render him the honor which was his
due; that he was ready to have a conference with
him in their presence and within their hearing.
They were satisfied with this and agreed to conduct
him into the Capitol and act as mediators in the
reconciliation if he should so desire. He then
assented and immediately went up into the temple
of <a id="TA_27A" href="#TN_27">Jupiter</a>, and sent them after Octavian.</p>

<p class="pt1">They were pleased and went to his house in a
great body, so that he felt some anxiety when it
was announced that there was a large crowd of soldiers
outside and that some were in the house looking
for him. In his agitation, he first went upstairs
with his friends who happened to be present,
and looking down, asked the men what they wanted
and why they had come, and then he discovered that
they were his own soldiers. They answered
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
they had come for his own good and that of his whole
party, if he also was willing to forget what Antonius
had done, for his actions had not been pleasing to
them either; that he and Antonius ought to put aside
all resentment and be reconciled simply and sincerely.
Then one of them called out in a somewhat louder voice
and bade him be of good cheer and be assured that he
had inherited all their support, for they thought of
his late father as of a god, and would do and suffer
anything for his successors. Another one shouted
out still more loudly and said that he would make
away with Antonius with his own hands if he did not
observe the provisions of Caesar’s will and keep
faith with the senate. Octavian, encouraged at this,
went downstairs to them, and embracing them showed
much pleasure at their eager good will toward him.
They seized him and led him in triumph through the
forum to the Capitol, vieing with each other in
their zeal, some because of their dislike of Antonius’
rule and others out of reverence for Caesar and his
heir; others led on (and rightly enough) by the
hope of obtaining great advantages at his hands,
and still others who were eager for revenge on the
assassins, believing that this would be
accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
most readily through the boy if they had the assistance
of the consul also. In fact, all those who
approached him advised him out of good will not to
be contentious but to think of their own safety,
and how he could gain more supporters, remembering
how unexpected Caesar’s death had been. Octavian
heard all this and saw that the people’s zeal for
him was natural; he then entered the Capitol and
saw there many more of his father’s soldiers, on
whom Antonius was relying, but who were really far
better disposed toward himself, if Antonius should
try to injure him in any way. The majority of the
throng withdrew and the two leaders with their
friends were left to discuss the
situation.<a id="FA_155" href="#FN_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">30.</span>
When Octavian went home after his reconciliation
with Antonius, the latter, left to himself,
became provoked again at seeing the good will of
all the soldiers inclining very much toward
Octavian.<a id="FA_156" href="#FN_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
For they held that he was Caesar’s son and that he
had been proclaimed his heir in his will, that he
was called by the same name and that he exhibited
excellent promise from the very energy of his nature,
of which Caesar had taken cognizance in bringing
about his adoption no less than of his degree
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
kinship, in the belief that he alone might be
entrusted with preserving all of Caesar’s authority
and the dignity of his house. When Antonius reflected
on all this he changed his mind again, especially
when he saw the Caesarian soldiers desert him right
before his eyes and escort Octavian in a body from
the temple. Some thought that he would not have
refrained from apprehending Octavian, had he not
been in fear of the soldiers, lest they should set
on him and mete out punishment, easily diverting
all his faction from him; for each of them had an
army which was waiting to see how things would turn
out. Reflecting on all this, he still delayed and
hesitated, although he had changed his mind. Octavian,
however, actually believing that the reconciliation
between them was in good faith, went every
day to Antonius’ house, as was quite proper, since
Antonius was consul and an older man and a friend
of his father’s; and he paid him every other respect
according to his promise until Antonius did him a
second wrong in the following manner: Having acquired
the province of Gaul in exchange for
Macedonia,<a id="FA_157" href="#FN_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
he transferred the troops which were in
the latter place to Italy, and when they
arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
he left Rome and went down as far as Brundisium to meet
them.<a id="FA_158" href="#FN_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
Then, thinking that he had a suitable
opportunity for what he had in mind, he spread a
report that he was being plotted against, and seizing
some soldiers, he threw them into chains, on the
pretext that they had been sent for this very purpose
of killing him. He hinted at Octavian but did not
definitely name him. The report quickly ran through
the city that the consul had been plotted against,
but had seized the men who had come to attack him.
Then his friends gathered at his house, and soldiers
under arms were summoned. In the late afternoon
the report reached Octavian also that Antonius had
been in danger of being assassinated, and that he
was sending for troops to guard him that night. Immediately
Octavian sent word to him that he was
ready to stand beside his bed with his own retinue
to keep him safe, for he thought that the plot had
been laid by some of the party of Brutus and Cassius.
He was thus in readiness to do an act of kindness
entirely unsuspicious of the rumor Antonius had
started or of the plot. Antonius, however, did not
even permit the messenger to be received indoors,
but dismissed him discourteously. The
messenger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
returned after hearing fuller reports and announced
to Octavian that his name was being mentioned among
the men about Antonius’ door as being himself the
man who had despatched the assassins against Antonius,
who now were in prison. Octavian when he heard this
at first did not believe it because of its improbable
sound, but soon he <a id="TA_41" href="#TN_41">perceived</a>
that the whole plan had been directed against himself, so
he considered with his friends as to what he should do.
Philippus and Atia<a id="FA_159" href="#FN_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
his mother came also, at loss over the strange
turn of affairs, and desiring to know what the report
meant and what were Antonius’ intentions. They advised
Octavian to withdraw from the city at once for
a few days until the matter could be investigated
and cleared up. He, unconscious of any guilt, thought
that it would be a serious matter for him to conceal
himself and in a way incriminate himself, for he
would gain nothing toward his safety by withdrawing,
while he might the more easily be destroyed in secret
if he were away from home. Such was the discussion
in which he was then engaged.</p>

<p class="pt1">On the following morning he sat as usual with
his friends and gave orders that the doors be opened
to those of his townsmen, guests, and soldiers
who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
were accustomed to visit him and greet him, and he
conversed with them all in his usual way, in no wise
changing his daily routine. But Antonius called an
assembly of his friends and said in their presence
that he was aware that Octavian had even earlier been
plotting against him, and that when he was to leave
the city to go to the army that had come for him,
he had provided Octavian with this opportunity
against him. That one of the men sent to accomplish
the crime had, by means of substantial bribes, turned
informer in the matter; and hence he had seized the
others; and he had now called his friends together
to hear their opinions as to what should be done in
the light of the recent events. When Antonius had
spoken the members of his council asked to be shown
where the men were who had been seized, so that
they might find out something from them. Then
Antonius pretended that this had nothing to do with
the present business, since, forsooth, it had already
been confessed to; and he turned the discourse into
other channels, watching eagerly for someone to
propose that they ought to take vengeance on
Octavian and not quietly submit. However, they
all sat in silent thought, since no apparent
proof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
lay before them, until someone said that Antonius
would do well to dismiss the assembly, saying that
he ought to act moderately and not stir up any disturbance,
for he was consul. After this discussion,
Antonius dismissed the assembly. Two or three days
afterward, he set out for Brundisium to take over
the army which had now arrived there. There was no
further discussion about the plot, and when he left,
his friends who remained behind dismissed the whole
matter, and no one ever saw any of the conspirators
who were alleged to have been taken.<a id="FA_160" href="#FN_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p class="pt0"><span class="ps0">31.</span>Octavian, although now exonerated from the
charge, was none the less chagrined at the talk
about him, interpreting it as evidence of a great
conspiracy against him. He thought that if Antonius
had happened to get the army on his side by means
of bribes he would not have delayed in attacking
him, not because he had been wronged in any respect,
but simply led on to that course as an outcome of
his former hopes. It was manifest that a man who
had concocted this charge would go further to others
and that he would have been eager to do this from
the first if he had not had to fear the army.
Accordingly Octavian was filled with righteous
indignation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
against Antonius and with some concern for
his own person, now that the other’s intention had
become plain. Reviewing all contingencies, he saw
that he must not remain quiet, for this was not
safe, but that he must seek out some aid wherewith
to oppose the other’s power and strategems. So
then, reflecting upon this question, he decided that
he had better take refuge in his father’s colonies,
where his father had granted allotments and founded
cities, to remind the people of Caesar’s beneficence
and to bewail his fate and his own sufferings, and
thus to secure their support, attracting them also
by gifts of money. He thought that this would be
his only safe course, that it would redound greatly
to his fame, and that it would also redeem the
prestige of his family. It was a far better and
juster course than to be pushed aside out of his
inherited honor by men who had no claim to it, and
finally to be foully and nefariously slain just as
his father had been. After consulting over this
with his friends and after sacrificing, with good
fortune, to the gods, that they might be his assistants
in his just and glorious endeavor, he set out,
taking with him a considerable sum of money,
first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
of all into Campania where were the Seventh and
Eighth Legions (for that is what the Romans call
their regiments). He thought that he ought first
to sound the feelings of the Seventh, for its fame
was greater, and with this colony aligned in his
favor, and many others with it
...<a id="FA_161" href="#FN_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
and in this plan and in the events that followed,
he had the approval of his friends. These were: Marcus
Agrippa, Lucius Maecenas, Quintus Juventius, Marcus
Modialius, and Lucius.<a id="FA_162" href="#FN_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Other officers, centurions,
and soldiers followed, as well as a multitude of
slaves and a pack train carrying the pay-money and
the supplies. As for his mother,<a id="FA_163" href="#FN_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> he decided not
to acquaint her with his plan, lest, out of affection
and weakness, like a woman and a mother, she
might be a hindrance to his great purpose. He gave
out openly that he was going to Campania to sell
some of his father’s property there, to take the
money and put it to the uses that his father had
enjoined. But even so, he went off entirely without
her consent.</p>

<p class="pt1">At that time Marcus Brutus and Gaius Cassius
were at Dicaearchia,<a id="FA_164" href="#FN_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and when they learned of the
throng that was accompanying Octavian from
Rome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
(the messengers having exaggerated the report, as
usually happens) they were struck with much fear
and consternation, thinking that the expedition was
directed against themselves. They took to flight
across the Adriatic. Brutus went to
<a id="TA_31" href="#TN_31">Achaea</a>,
Cassius to Syria. When Octavian arrived in Calatia in Campania,
<a id="FA_165" href="#FN_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
the inhabitants received him as the son of
their benefactor and treated him with the highest
honor. On the following day he disclosed the whole
situation to them and he appealed to the soldiers,
telling them how unjustly his father had been killed
and how he was himself being plotted against. As he
spoke, some of the decurions did not wish to listen
at all, but the people did so eagerly and with <a id="TA_24" href="#TN_24">good will</a>,
and they sympathized with him, frequently bidding
him to be of good cheer, for they would not
neglect him but would assist him in every way until
he should be established in his inherited rights.
Then he invited them to his house and gave each of
them five hundred drachmae; and the next day he
called together the members of the curia and appealed
to them not to be outdone in good will by the people,
but to remember Caesar who had given them the colony
and their position of honor. He promised that they
would experience no less benefits at his own
hands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
He showed that it was more fitting for him to enjoy
their aid and to make use of their influence and
arms than for Antonius to do so. They were aroused
to a greater zeal to help him and to undertake trouble
and danger with him if need be. Octavian commended
their zeal and asked them to accompany him as far as
the neighboring colonies, and furnish him safe-conduct.
The people were pleased at this and gladly
complied, <a id="TA_42" href="#TN_42">escorting</a> him
under arms to the next
colony.<a id="FA_166" href="#FN_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
And gathering these also into an assembly, he addressed
them. He succeeded in persuading both legions to
escort him to Rome through the other colonies to
Rome and strenuously to repel any act of violence
on the part of Antonius. He attracted other soldiers
also with high pay, and on the march he trained and
instructed the new recruits, sometimes individually
and sometimes in squads, telling them that they were
going against Antonius. He sent some of his followers
who were preeminent for intelligence and daring to
Brundisium,<a id="FA_167" href="#FN_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
to see if they could also win the
forces just arrived from Macedonia over to his side,
bidding them remember his father Caesar and not to
betray his son. He instructed his propagandists
that if they could not achieve their purpose in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
open, they were to write this out and scatter it
all about so that the men could pick up the notices
and read them;<a id="FA_168" href="#FN_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
and in order that they might join
his party he made promises that filled the rest
with hope of what they would receive from him when
he came into his power. So they departed.</p>

<h2>COMMENTARY</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">1.</span><a id="FN_1" href="#FA_1">[1]</a>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Sebastos">Σεβαστός</span>, Augustus, must be
understood. The word
was doubtless given in the context immediately preceding
the present opening sentence. The title was proposed
by Plancus and was ratified by the senate on January
16, 27 B.C. (CIL 1<sup>2</sup> p. 307, Suet., Aug. 7, 2; Dio 53,
16, 6-8; 20, 1; Liv., Epit. 134; Vell. 2, 91, 1; Flor. 2, 34;
Mon. Anc. 6, 16). Nicolaus attaches no significance of
divinity to the title, though Suetonius and Dio do so.
Verg., Ec. 1, 6; G. 1, 24-39, speaks of Octavian as divine,
but no attribute of divinity is mentioned in the Aeneid
with reference to Augustus.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_2" href="#FA_2">[2]</a>
Nicolaus does not necessarily infer that an imperial
cult existed at this period in Italy, and hence is not
at variance with Suet., Aug. 52; Dio 51, 20, where it is
stated that Augustus did not permit an imperial cult in
Italy, although he allowed temples to be erected to
‘Rome and Augustus’ in the provinces. See also H.
Heinen, Klio 11, pp. 139 ff.; W. S. Ferguson, Am. Hist. Rev.,
18, pp. 243 ff. J. Asbach, Rh. Mus., 37, p. 297, is mistaken
in reasoning that Augustus must have died before any
worship could have taken place. L. R. Taylor, Trans. Am.
Philol. Ass., 51, p. 124 suggests that whatever savored of
an imperial cult in Italy from 30 B.C. on, was in fact
simply a cult of the <i>genius</i> of the emperor (Dio 51, 19,
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
7; Ov., Fast. 2, 637; Hor., Od. 4, 5, 31-35).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_3" href="#FA_3">[3]</a>
Drusus’ expedition of 11 B.C. is probably alluded to
(Vell., 2, 97, 2-3; Suet., Aug., 21; Dio 35, 2, 4; Tac., Ann.,
2, 26, 12, 39). There is a noteworthy consonance between
the phrase of Nicolaus, ‘nor had they been subject within
the memory of any one’ and Mon. Anc., 5, 44,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pannoniorum gentes quas ante
me principem populi Romani exercitus nunquam adiit.</span>’
This may be due to the use by Nicolaus of Augustus’ memoirs.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_4" href="#FA_4">[4]</a>Adriatic.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_5" href="#FA_5">[5]</a>
Tiberius succeeded Agrippa as leader of expeditions
against the Pannonians (Mon. Anc., 30; Dio 54, 36, 2-3).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_6" href="#FA_6">[6]</a>
A remark of the excerptor is enclosed within the
parentheses.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">2.</span><a id="FN_7" href="#FA_7">[7]</a>
Nicolaus employs the method of a Peripatetic in presenting
the order of events in the life of an individual.
(Leo, die Griech. Röm. Biogr., p. 190).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_8" href="#FA_8">[8]</a>
His family was from Velitrae (Suet., Aug., 1, 94; Dio
45, 1, 1). C. Octavius the father was praetor (Cic., Q.
frat. 1, 1, 7) and proconsul for Macedonia (Suet., Aug., 3;
CIL 6, 1311) and was only prevented by death from attaining
the consulship. (Cic., Phil., 3, 6, 15).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_9" href="#FA_9">[9]</a>
C. Octavius is characterized as rich by Velleius (2, 59).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_10" href="#FA_10">[10]</a>
C. Octavius died in 58 B.C. when his son was 4 years
old (Suet., Aug., 8).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_11" href="#FA_11">[11]</a>
One of those involved was C. Toranius, who had been
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
an aedile with the elder C. Octavius (CIL 6, 1311). He
was in due time proscribed by Augustus, (App., 4, 12; Suet.,
Aug., 27) so that Octavius’ remission of his claims and
apparent satisfaction with his remainder as expressed by
Nicolaus did not prevent a subsequent day of reckoning.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">3.</span><a id="FN_12" href="#FA_12">[12]</a>
Nicolaus’ statement of Octavius’ age is not corroborated
by Suetonius (Aug. 8) nor by Quintilian (12, 6, 1)
who give Octavius’ age as 12 years when the oration was
given. Perhaps separate occasions are referred to by
Nicolaus and the other writers. If a closer agreement
is to be desired,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="ennea">ἐννέα</span>
could be altered to
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="hendeka">ἕνδεκα</span>
(Müller). Suetonius identifies this occasion with the
death of Octavius’ grandmother Julia, while Nicolaus
does not expressly do so. His mention of Julia’s death
in the following sentence, however, admits of the inference
that the one occurrence suggested the other to his
mind, and that there was therefore some connection between
them.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_13" href="#FA_13">[13]</a>
With a single exception the name Atia is written
Antia throughout the excerpt. She was C. Octavius’
second wife (Plut., Ant. 31) and was from Aricia (Cic.,
Phil., 3, 6, 16; Suet., Aug., 4).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_14" href="#FA_14">[14]</a>
Incorrect as the text stands. Valesius indicated
that L. Marcius Philippus’ ancestor, Q. Marcius Philippus,
was engaged not with Philip V of Macedonia but
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span> with his son
Perseus (CIL 1, p. 359). Either Nicolaus was misinformed, or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Philippon">Φίλιππον</span>
has been inserted in the text by attraction in place of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Persea">Περσέα</span>. Cicero (Att.

Amyntas was the father of the great Philip of Macedon.</p>

<p class="ft2">Q. Philippus was actually in Macedonia during Philip’s
lifetime according to Livy (39, 48; 40, 2-3). The passage

descended from the noble Marcii active during the 2nd
century B.C.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_15" href="#FA_15">[15]</a>
Octavius’ youth was spent in Rome and the vicinity
(Suet., Aug. 94).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_16" href="#FA_16">[16]</a>

L. Philippus had a country place near Cicero’s at

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_19" href="#FA_19">[19]</a>
On October 18, 48 B.C. (CIL 10, 8375; Dessau, Ins.
Lat. Sel., 108) since Octavius was born on September 23,
63 B.C., he was about 15 years old. Suetonius is correct
in Aug. 8 where he speaks of Octavius as in his
twelfth year, that is 11 years of age, and places the
assumption of the toga virilis 4 years later.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_20" href="#FA_20">[20]</a>
L. Domitius Ahenobarbus
was killed at Pharsalus (Cic., <span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Phil., 2, 71; Caes., B. C., 3, 99; Suet., Nero, 2). Culex 26 and 27,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Octavi venerande</span>’ and
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sancte puer</span>’ show that
this was addressed to Octavius after his election to
the office of pontifex; see Class. Philol. 15, p. 26.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_21" href="#FA_21">[21]</a>
The election of Octavius was, of course, at the request
of Julius Caesar.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_22" href="#FA_22">[22]</a>
That of pontifex (Cic., Phil., 5, 17; Vell., 2, 59).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_23" href="#FA_23">[23]</a>
Valesius took this to be a reference to a custom
prevalent in Rome in Cicero’s time. Foppish young men
and even senators were to be seen arrayed not in the
ordinary Roman, but in Eastern garb. See Cic., pro Rab.
Post., 10, 27, where, however, there is a slight corruption
of the text.</p>

In the autumn of 47, if both consuls were present as Nicolaus says. The
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Feriae Latinae</span> were inaugurated in
49 (CIL 1, p. 440, Fasti Cos. Capitolini). The following
year, 48, Caesar was absent in the East, as was also the
case in 46 and 45. In 45 ‘a certain prefect’ conducted the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Feriae</span> (Dio 43, 48) for Caesar was
then sole consul; in 48 and 46 the other consul was probably in charge.
For 48 this was <a id="TA_32" href="#TN_32">Servilius</a> Isauricus and
for 46, Lepidus.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_25" href="#FA_25">[25]</a> As
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefectus urbi</span>. Nicolaus is correct
and the other authors are wrong. App., 3, 9; Dio 43, 51; Plin.,
N. H., 7, 147 say that Octavius became
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister equitum</span>
in this year. Gardthausen,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aug. und seine Zeit</span>, p. 48,
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span> shows that there
is a possibility for confusion between the terms
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefectus urbi</span> and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister equitum</span> in the
writings of the later Greek historians. The latter office
would be considerably too responsible for a youth of 16
years, while it is conceivable that the duties of
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefectus urbi</span>, at least
during the period of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Feriae</span>
when the city was almost entirely deserted, would not be
excessively onerous. Strabo 5, C. 229 and Dio 49, 42 show
that the practice of appointing youths for this office
was continued by Augustus.</p>

to the battle at Zela

(Caes., B. Af., 2).</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">7.</span><a id="FN_32" href="#FA_32">[32]</a>
Caesar arrived July 29, 46 B.C. (Caes., B. Af. 98). The
decisive battle was Thapsus, April 6, reported in Rome
about April 20 (Cic., Fam. 9, 2).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_33" href="#FA_33">[33]</a>
It was Caesar’s practice to put to death any who fell
captive to him a second time (Dio 41, 62; 43, 17; 44, 45;
44, 46; Suet., Caes., 75). In describing the incident
which follows, however, Nicolaus seems to have exaggerated
the importance of Octavius’ exploit, for in every case of
similar circumstances Caesar allowed each of his subordinates
to secure the release of one prisoner. Dio 43,
12-13 says further that Caesar released Cato’s son and
‘most of the rest.’ Nicolaus evidently drew from Augustus’
personal memoirs of his youth for this portion of
the biography, and found it advantageous to emphasize
Octavius’ act at this juncture. For a contemporary commentary,
see Cic., Fam. 6, 13, 3, where Caesar is said to
be especially incensed at those involved in the African
<a id="TA_43" href="#TN_43">disturbance</a>, but that
with the lapse of time he seems
to have become more indulgent toward them.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_34" href="#FA_34">[34]</a>
This is the first indication that Agrippa was already
a companion of Octavius. See Sen., Epis., 15, 2, 46.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">8.</span><a id="FN_35" href="#FA_35">[35]</a>
Caesar had 4 triumphs: for Gaul, Egypt, Pontus, and
Africa (Liv., Epit., 115; App., 2, 101; Dio 43, 19).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_36" href="#FA_36">[36]</a>
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
Octavius was, through his mother, grandson of Caesar’s
sister Julia. Suetonius (Caes. 83, 1) is explicit in
stating that Caesar’s will whereby Octavius was adopted
as Caesar’s son, was made on September 13, 45 B.C. Nicolaus
has here either anticipated this accepted date by
something more than a year, or else he had access to a
statement in Augustus’ memoirs to the effect that Octavius
knew of the existence of an earlier will in which he had
been made Caesar’s adopted son.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_37" href="#FA_37">[37]</a>
Nicolaus is probably referring to the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognomen imperatoris</span>’
and not to the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praenomen imperatoris</span>.’
According to Dio 43, 44, the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praenomen imperatoris</span>’
was not conferred upon Caesar until after the battle of Munda,
some seven months later. However, if Nicolaus felt any unusual
significance in the title
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Imperator</span> as here mentioned, we
have an indication that Caesar actually held the new title
prior to the date given by Dio. Suetonius (Caes. 76) including
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praenomen imperatoris</span>’ in a group
of various honors conferred upon Caesar, gives no date or correlative
occurrence in this connection. See McFayden, The History
of the Title Imperator under the Roman Empire, Chicago
1920, pp. 7 ff.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">9.</span><a id="FN_38" href="#FA_38">[38]</a>
The plays and games (Cic., Fam. 12, 18, 2; Livy, Epit.,
115; Dio 43, 22-24; App. 2, 102; Plut., Caes., 55; Suet.,
Aug., 39; Vell. 2, 56) were given immediately after Caesar’s
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
dedication of the temple to Venus Genetrix on September
26, (= July 20 corrected calendar) 46 B.C. Augustus continued
these games annually as the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi Victoriae Caesaris</span>’
on July 25. Vergil seems to have them in mind in writing Aeneid 5 and
<a id="TA_44" href="#TN_44">Catalepton</a> 14, see Class. Quart. 14,
p. 156. The
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi Romani</span> and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi Graeci</span> were
given separately (Suet., Aug. 45; Tac., Annal. 14, 15). See also
CIL 6, 32323; Dessau, Ins. Lat., 5050, an account of the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ludi Saeculares</span> of 17 B.C. In addition
to the Theatre of Pompey, a temporary wooden stage was erected for the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi Latini</span> in 46 B.C. as in 17 B.C.
(line 154 of the inscription).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_39" href="#FA_39">[39]</a>
The effects of the sunstroke were, however, apparently
lasting throughout Octavius’ life. He was unable to
withstand the Italian sun even in winter, and never
went out into the open without a hat (Suet., Aug., 82).</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">10.</span><a id="FN_40" href="#FA_40">[40]</a>
To Spain. He started apparently in November of
46 B.C. He was still in Rome on September 24 (Cic.,
Fam., 6, 14, 2). Nearly a month was consumed in his
journey thither (Strabo 3, 4, 9; App. 2, 103; Suet., Caes.,
56).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_41" href="#FA_41">[41]</a>
Sextus Pompeius had 11 legions in all. Caesar had
sent to Cicero in January, 45 B.C., a copy of a letter
which he had received from L. Vibius Paciaecus, one
of his subordinates in Spain who was in a position to
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
know, and who gave this figure (Cic., Fam., 6, 18, 2).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_42" href="#FA_42">[42]</a>
Seven months had not elapsed between Caesar’s departure
from Rome and the battle of Munda (March 17,
45 B.C.).</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">11.</span><a id="FN_43" href="#FA_43">[43]</a>
Carteia, on the Bay of Gibraltar. Octavius must
have arrived after the battle of Munda had taken place,
otherwise Nicolaus certainly would have mentioned his
presence at that encounter, Caesar’s last successful
one. Caesar wrote to Cicero from Hispalis, his next
stopping point (Caes., B. Hisp., 39) on April 30 (Cic.,
Att., 13, 20, 1). Octavius’ arrival at Carteia was therefore
some time in May.</p>

<a id="TA_34" href="#TN_34">Lacuna</a> of 2 pages.
The information embodied in
chapters 10-12 is unique with Nicolaus and hence does
not permit of any basis for comparison with other
writers. Suet., Aug., 8 makes the brief statement
that Octavian proceeded to Spain to join his great-uncle
after recovering from his illness; Vell. 2, 59, 3
briefly notes that Octavius was with Caesar, and Dio
43, 41, in alluding to the prodigy of the sprouting
palm, seems to infer that Octavius was present during
the entire expedition, including Munda. This portion
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of Nicolaus’ biography shows every indication of having
been compiled with much dependence upon Augustus’
memoirs. It is possible that Nicolaus enlarged upon
the importance of Octavius’ actions in these chapters
over and above the material which he found in Augustus’
memoirs; however, the tone of the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Monumentum Ancyranum</span>
shows that false modesty, at least, was not over-evident in
the character of the autobiographer in that case, and it is
conceivable therefore that Nicolaus has repeated Augustus’
words much as he found them.</p>

no restoration, but prints simply

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_47" href="#FA_47">[47]</a>
C. Claudius Marcellus, consul in 50 B.C., and at
that time a vigorous opponent of Julius Caesar (Cic.,
Brut., 64, 229; Plin., N. H., 2, 147; Suet., Caes., 29; App.
2, 26; Dio 40, 44; Pauly-Wissowa, Claudius, 216). He
and the members of his immediate family were warmly
congratulated by Cicero at the time of his attainment
of the office of consul (Cic., Fam., 15, 7; 15, 8; 15, 9;
15, 10; 15, 11), and Cicero later mentioned him as being
in accord, apparently at least, with his own views
(Cic., Att., 10, 12, 3).</p>

<p class="ft2"><span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
When the civil war broke out he remained in Italy, coming
to terms with Caesar. After Caesar’s death he gave
his support to his young brother-in-law Octavian. The
family can be traced back 8 generations to M. Claudius
Marcellus, consul in 331 B.C.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_48" href="#FA_48">[48]</a> Drawn,
as has been noted (chap. 8, <a id="TA_26A" href="#TN_26">note</a> <a id="FX48_36" href="#FN_36">36</a>) on September
13, 45 B.C. This passage proves that Nicolaus knew the
facts about the will and that the statement in chap. 8
is at least careless.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_49" href="#FA_49">[49]</a>
The statement as to the proportion of Octavius’ inheritance
agrees with Suet., Caes., 83, but is at variance
with Liv., Epit., 116, where one half of the total is
assigned to Octavius. Q. Pedius and L. Pinarius were
the other beneficiaries (Suet., Caes., 83, 2; App. 3, 22; 23;
94; Plin., N. H., 35, 21).</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">14.</span><a id="FN_50" href="#FA_50">[50]</a>
Pseudo-Marius, otherwise Herophilus or Amatius, was
a well-known character (Cic., Att., 12, 49, 1; 14, 6, 1;
Phil. 1, 2, 5; App. 3, 2). After Caesar’s death he erected
an altar or column on the place where Caesar’s body
had been burned and was responsible for much rioting
there. Antony finally put him to death, to the relief
of Cicero (Cic., Att., 14, 7, 1; 14, 8, 1; App. 3, 3); see
also Val. Max. 9, 15, 1; Liv., Epit., 116.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_51" href="#FA_51">[51]</a>
Caesar’s aunt, Julia, who died in 68 B.C., was the
wife of the great C. Marius (Plut., Caes., 1, 1).</p>

Caesar, not the senate, declared Octavius a patrician.
L. Cassius, tribune in 44 B.C. (Cic., Phil., 3, 23),
introduced a special decree whereby the senate granted
Caesar the power of declaring persons of his choice
to be patricians (Tac., Ann., 11, 25; Suet., Caes., 41;
Dio 43, 47, 3). One of those chosen thus was Octavius
(Suet., Aug., 2; Dio 45, 2, 7); see E. Meyer,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Caesars Monarchie</span>,
etc. Stuttgart 1919, p. 464.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">16.</span><a id="FN_54" href="#FA_54">[54]</a>
Apollonia. According to Nicolaus, Octavius left
Rome in December, and was therefore in Apollonia for
3 months before the murder of Caesar. This is at
variance with App. 3, 9, where Octavius is said to have
been in Apollonia for 6 months. In the latter case
he would have had to leave Rome immediately after his
return from Spain, which is not very probable in view
of the plausible details given by Nicolaus in the
preceding chapter.</p>

<p class="ft2">The use of the word
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="entauthoi">ἐνταυθοῖ</span> (Müller),
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="entautha">ἐνταῦθα</span> (Dindorf)
with reference to Apollonia, gives the impression
that Nicolaus wrote the ‘Life of Augustus’ at
that place. Chapters 16 and 17 are written with considerable
detail concerning the behavior of the inhabitants
just prior to Octavius’ departure, and the account
is, among the historians, unique with Nicolaus. The
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
city was one of importance (Cic., Phil., 11, 11, 26), and
a favorite stopping point for travellers between Asia
and Rome via Brundisium. See O. E. Schmidt,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrb. für Class. Philol.</span>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_55" href="#FA_55">[55]</a>
Octavius was accompanied to Apollonia by his friends
M. Agrippa and Q. Salvidienus Rufus (Suet., Aug., 94;
<a id="TA_45" href="#TN_45">Vell.</a> 2, 59, 5).
His instructor in rhetoric was the famous
Apollodorus of Pergamum (Suet., Aug., 89; Strabo 13, 4, 3;
Quint. 3, 1, 17). Caesar sent his nephew to Apollonia
to be trained in military tactics in anticipation of
an expedition against the Parthians (Suet., Aug., 8; App.
3, 9; Dio 45, 3; Plut., Brut., 22; Cic., 43; Ant. 16; Vell.
2, 59, 4; Liv., Epit., 117).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_56" href="#FA_56">[56]</a> Codex,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Aimilios">Αἰμίλιος</span>. Müller has
suggested that M. Aemilius Scaurus is the individual here referred
to. He was, however, banished by Pompey in 52 B.C. (App.,
2, 24; Cic., Off., 1, 38; Q. Fr., 3, 8, 4), and little is
known of his subsequent actions. His son, of the same
name, was with Antony at Actium (Dio 51, 2; 56, 38).
The only other contemporaneous Aemilii were L. Aemilius
Paullus and his son L. Aemilius Lepidus Paullus. The
former was in Rome in April, 44 B.C. (Cic., Att., 14, 7, 1;
14, 8, 1) thus precluding a command in Macedonia; the
latter accompanied Octavian against Sextus Pompeius in
Sicily, 42-36 B.C. (Suet., Aug., 16). E. Schwartz,

<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Manios Akilios">Μάνιος Ἀκίλιος</span>
on the basis of Cic., Fam., 7, 30, 3,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acilius, qui in Graeciam
cum legionibus missus est.</span>’
The date of the letter is January, 44 B.C. It is to
be noted that Cicero gives no praenomen in the letter;
elsewhere, the MS readings are divided between ‘Manius’
and ‘Marcus’ (Caes., B. C., 3, 15; 3, 16; 3, 39; Dio 42, 12).
Inasmuch as Nicolaus has written the praenomen ‘Marcus’
without abbreviation, an alteration to ‘Manius’ is
scarcely justifiable in view of the other MS tradition.
Marcus Acilius Caninus is the proper designation. See
Klebs, P. W. <a id="TA_46A" href="#TN_46">Real-Encycl</a>.,
1, p. 251, Acilius 15. He was a
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">legatus</span>’
of Caesar and was at Oricum in 48 B.C. (Caes., B. C., loc. cit.).

codex, and is retained in the editions of Müller and Dindorf. No associate
of Octavius bearing this name is elsewhere mentioned, and since the
statement is here made that he returned to his home at Pergamum, Müller
suggests that Apollodorus is here intended to be represented.

references. Piccolos has altered the reading to
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Apollodôros">Ἀπολλόδωρος</span> (see his note,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nicolas de Damas, Vie de César</span>,
Paris 1850, p. 85). It is possible that Nicolaus, through the
use <a id="TA_47" href="#TN_47">of</a> Augustus’ memoirs, actually came
upon some such name <span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
as Alexander; if not, the reading ‘Alexander’ is attributable
to an error of the excerptor. Apollodorus is
described as being old at the time of the trip to
Apollonia by Suet., Aug., 89.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_58" href="#FA_58">[58]</a>
Four years earlier Caesar had been amicably received
by the inhabitants of Apollonia. Hence the appropriate
application of the term ‘friendly city’ even though
their action had been possibly influenced as much by
expediency as by conviction in 48 B.C. (Caes., B. C., 3,
10-13; App. 2, 54-55; Dio 41, 45, 1; 41, 47, 1).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_59" href="#FA_59">[59]</a> Strabo 7, C. 316,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="polis eunomôtatê">πόλις εὐνομωτάτη</span> as applied to
Apollonia, is reminiscent of Nicolaus’ expression,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="eudaimona tên polin en tois malista poiêsas">εὐδαίμονα τὴν πόλιν ἐν τοῖς μάλιστα ποιήσας</span>.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_60" href="#FA_60">[60]</a>
Nicolaus gives a more detailed account of Octavius’
landing in Italy than do the other historians (App. 3, 10;
Dio 45, 3; Vell. 2, 50). Beside Nicolaus only Appian
mentions the fact that Octavius stopped first at Lupiae
before proceeding to Brundisium.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_61" href="#FA_61">[61]</a>
See note <a id="FX61_49" href="#FN_49">49</a>, chapter 13, and the
citations there appended. Pedius and Pinarius are the only
co-inheritors with Octavian according to Suet., Caes., 83, 2.
Dio 44, 35 gives 30 and 75 denarii as alternative sums, to be paid
each citizen according to the terms of the will. App.
3, 23 states that the shares of Pedius and Pinarius
were requisitioned by Octavian to help make good the
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
amount to be distributed to the people. ‘Drachma’ and
‘denarius’ are to be understood as synonymous in the
accounts of Dio and Nicolaus, though not properly identical
in value.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_62" href="#FA_62">[62]</a>
Senate was convened in the temple of Tellus on
March 17, two days after the assassination, on the day
of the Liberalia (Cic., Att., 14, 10, 1; 14, 14, 2; App.
2, 126; Dio 44, 22). Plut., Brut., 19 erroneously places
the meeting of the senate on March 16.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_63" href="#FA_63">[63]</a> Caesar named Lepidus
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magister equitum iterum</span>’ for
the year 44 (CIL 1, p. 440; 466; Dio 43, 49, 1; Suet., Caes.,
82; Plin., N. H., 7, 147).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_65" href="#FA_65">[65]</a>
Probably a parenthesis by Nicolaus, and not a part
of the report that Octavius heard at the time. Brutus
and Cassius apparently did not leave Rome at once.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">18.</span><a id="FN_66" href="#FA_66">[66]</a>
See App., 3, 11.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_67" href="#FA_67">[67]</a>
L. Philippus, as late as the middle of the ensuing
June, was still not at all sanguine of Octavius’ prospects,
but thought that nothing ought to be entrusted
to him, after having taken due regard for his age, his
name, his inheritance, and his training (Cic., Att., 15,
12, 2). With respect to the advice of Philippus against
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
the assumption by Octavius of the name Caesar, see
Cicero’s comment, on April 22 (Att. 14, 12, 2):
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Octavius, quem quidem sui
Caesarem salutabant, Philippus non, itaque ne nos quidem.</span>’
See also Suet., Aug. 8; App. 3, 11; Vell. 2, 60, 1.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_68" href="#FA_68">[68]</a>
‘The state’ at this stage of events was, of course,
by no means unreservedly ‘on his side’, as Nicolaus
says. In point of fact, as we learn from Cicero’s
letters, very few men at Rome concerned themselves at
this time about Octavian because of his youth, Nicolaus
is valuable here because he draws upon Octavian’s
memoirs and reveals how early Octavian matured his
plans to become Caesar’s successor in power as well as
property. The attitude of the consul Antony is well
known (see Suet., Aug., 10; Plut., Ant. 16). Octavian felt
that the influence of Cicero was worth cultivating, and hence
while staying with his step-father at the villa adjacent to that
of Cicero at Puteoli, during the latter part of April, made the
most of every opportunity to ingratiate himself with Cicero:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nobiscum hic perhonorifice et
peramice Octavius</span>;’
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Octavius ... mihi totus deditus</span>.’
(Cic., Att., 14, 11, 2; 14, 12, 2). Before the middle of May, the
tribune L. Antonius presented Octavius to the people as Caesar’s
heir (Cic., Att., 14, 20, 5; 14, 21, 4; 15, 2, 3).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_69" href="#FA_69">[69]</a>
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
See App. 3, 10; 13; 14; Suet., Aug., 8; Vell. 2, 60, 1.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_70" href="#FA_70">[70]</a>
‘The name’ assumed by Octavius was not C. Julius
Caesar Octavianus as one would expect but C. Julius
C. f. Caesar (App. 3, 11; Dio 45, 3). Only his immediate
following, however, called him Caesar; Cicero at
this time called him Octavianus (Cic., Att. 14, 12, 2; 15, 12, 2;
Fam. 16, 24, 2). In the decrees of the senate reported in Cicero’s
Philippics during the next year he is referred to as C. Caesar
C.f. pontifex (Cic., Phil., 5, 17); this was after he had had his
adoption legally ratified by a
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex curiata</span>’ (App. 3, 94). He
had been striving toward this end for some time, but
had continually been prevented in his attempts by
Antony, who had, of course, always acted under the
cover of a subordinate official (Dio 45, 5, 3; 46, 47, 4).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_71" href="#FA_71">[71]</a>
For the ‘money and means’ to which Octavian had
access see App. 3, 11; Dio 45, 3, who refer rather
briefly to the matter.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_72" href="#FA_72">[72]</a>
By ‘public property’ is meant the provincial
tribute which apparently went into the Aerarium Saturni.
Caesar treated military funds that accrued from
booty as ‘his own’, and Octavian apparently appropriated
a part of this.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_73" href="#FA_73">[73]</a>
Octavian proceeded into Campania, where many of
Caesar’s veterans had settled between 59 and 49 B.C.
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
(M. Cary, Jour. Phil. 70, p. 174 ff.), in order to discover
what their probable disposition toward himself
would be (App. 3, 12). This was as early as April, 44
B.C., for on the 18th, Cicero, at Cumae, met one who
had on the same day encountered Octavian at Naples
(Cic., Att., 14, 10, 3). As Nicolaus remarks below, the
opportunity for levying an army did not seem to be at
hand; nevertheless Octavian felt that preliminary investigations
along these lines would not be out of
place.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_74" href="#FA_74">[74]</a>
A slight lacuna in the text exists at this point;
the context is not seriously affected, however. The
rendering of Müller has been reproduced here; Piccolos
and Dindorf attempt no restoration.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_75" href="#FA_75">[75]</a>
See the latter part of note <a id="FX75_70" href="#FN_70">70</a>, above.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_76" href="#FA_76">[76]</a>
Octavian approached Rome before April 10. His advent excited the
interest of Cicero, who inquired of Atticus how great a following
he was gathering and what new moves he was contemplating (Cic.,
Att. 14, 5, 3). The reply of Atticus may have been of a
disparaging nature toward Octavian; at any rate, Cicero again wrote
on April 12, disdainfully dismissing Octavian from his thoughts
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nam de Octavio, susque deque</span>.’
Even this early, however, there were rumors in Rome that the legions in
Macedonia were returning at <span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
Octavian’s call: ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odiosa illa enim
fuerant, legiones venire!</span>’ (Cic., Att., 14, 6, 1). See also
App. 3, 11; Dio 45, 3. On April 20, Cicero saw Octavian at Puteoli,
for Octavian had, after his canvass of Campania, proceeded
to his step-father’s villa at Puteoli, adjoining
the property of Cicero (Cic., Att., 14, 11, 2). Shortly
afterward, Octavian again went to Rome, stopping on
the way at Tarracina (App. 3, 12; Gardthausen, Augustus,
p. 53).</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">19.</span><a id="FN_77" href="#FA_77">[77]</a>
According to Plutarch, Brut. 10, the conspiracy was
well under way before March 1, 44 B.C.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_78" href="#FA_78">[78]</a>
Suetonius, Caes. 80, gives the number of conspirators
as 60; Eutropius, Brev. 6, 25, speaks of ‘60 or more.’ Of
the total number, some 20 can be definitely identified
by name; seven additional names have been erroneously
included among the number by various authors. The 20
fall into three divisions: Caesarians, 6; Pompeians, 10;
and those of uncertain partisanship, 4 (see Klotz, P. W.
<a id="TA_46B" href="#TN_46">Real-Encycl</a>. 10, p. 255).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_79" href="#FA_79">[79]</a>
Nicolaus’ contradiction is self-evident. Just after
saying that D. Brutus was a particular friend of Caesar,
he includes him with Cassius and M. Brutus as a former
member of the Pompeian faction. D. Brutus had, in fact,
been associated with Caesar at least since 56 B.C.:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. Brutum adulescentem classi Gallicisque
navibus ... [Caesar] praeficit</span>’
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
(Caes., B. G., 3, 11, 5). Again, in 52
B.C. Caesar placed him in charge of some of his land
forces during his engagement with Vercingetorix:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Brutum adulescentem his copiis
praeficit</span>;’ ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mittit primum
Brutum adulescentem cum cohortibus</span>’ (Caes., B. G.,
7, 9, 1; 7, 87, 1; B. C., 1; 36, 56, 58; 2, 3-7). When Caesar’s
will was read, it was found that D. Brutus had been
conditionally adopted by Caesar, subject to the death
of Octavian (App. 2, 143).</p>

<p class="ft2">Cassius was in command of Pompey’s sea-force in
the Hellespont at the time of the civil war. He there
surrendered to Caesar, though his capitulation seems
not to have been justified by the circumstances (App.
2, 88; Dio 42, 6; Suet., Caes., 63). Caesar subsequently
made him ‘legatus’ (Cic., Fam., 6, 6, 10; 15, 15, 2).</p>

<p class="ft2">M. Brutus joined Pompey in Macedonia before Pharsalia
(Plut., Brut. 4; Aurel. Vic., Vir. Illus. 82, 5).
After the battle he went over to Caesar. Appian, 2, 146,
makes the following statement: ‘all the murderers,
except Decimus alone, had been taken prisoners from
Pompey’s faction.’ The inaccuracy is similar to that
of Nicolaus.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_80" href="#FA_80">[80]</a>
The emendation of Müller,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="kaiper Kaisaros">καίπερ Καίσαρος</span>
has been followed here; that of Piccolos is also good. The
codex reading is unintelligible and that of Dindorf
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
is scarcely less so. He alters
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="hekastou">ἑκάστου</span> to
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="hekaston">ἕκαστον</span>,
but leaves the remainder intact.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_81" href="#FA_81">[81]</a>
The leniency of Caesar was, of course, not entirely
attributable to altruistic motives, although from the
tone of Nicolaus one might infer that such was the case.
Caesar explains his policy in Cic., Att., 9, 7c.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_82" href="#FA_82">[82]</a>
The claim of Brutus, that he was descended from
Brutus the first consul and Ahala the regicide, was
generally accepted as a fact both by historians and
contemporary writers (Cic., Att., 13, 40, 1,
‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="philotechnêma">φιλοτέχνημα</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">illud tuum, quod vidi in Parthenone,
Ahalam et Brutum</span>,’ see Tyrrell and Purser, The Correspondence
of Cicero, vol. 5, p. 177, note 1; vol. 6, p. cv; App. 2, 112; Dio 44, 12;
Plut., Brut. 1; Suet., Caes., 80).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_83" href="#FA_83">[83]</a>
Cassius and Brutus are, of course, the outstanding
examples of the type here referred to. For Caesar’s
treatment of his former opponents, see Plut., Caes. 57,
and citations in note <a id="FX83_79" href="#FN_79">79</a>, above.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_84" href="#FA_84">[84]</a>
The allusion is perhaps to the enthronement of a
statue of Caesar in the temple of Quirinus. Cicero
expressed much indignation in referring to the matter
(Cic., Att., 12, 45, 2; 13, 28, 3; Phil. 2, 43, 110; see also
Dio 43, 45; Suet., Caes., 76). Caesar was hailed further
as ‘Iuppiter Iulius’ and a temple was erected jointly
to him and to ‘Clementia’ (App. 2, 106; Dio 44, 6; Plut.,
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Caes., 57; less specific, Suet., Caes., 76; Flor. 2, 13, 91).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_85" href="#FA_85">[85]</a>
The conspirators were pledged among themselves without
the usual formalities of either oaths or sacrifices,
according to Appian, 2, 114, and Plutarch, Brut. 12.
Sacrifices were the proper complement of oaths, but the
attention which would have been drawn by their performance
would have been at once fatal to the projected
undertaking.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_86" href="#FA_86">[86]</a>
The same incident is reported by the following
authors: Appian 2, 116; Dio 44, 18; Suetonius, Caes., 81;
Plutarch, Caes., 65; Velleius 2, 57; Florus 4, 2, 94. It
is a noteworthy fact that with the passage of time the
statements with regard to this occurrence become more
positive. Nicolaus employs indirect discourse, placing
the responsibility on the writer used by him as a
source; all the other authors mention the matter as an
actual happening.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">20.</span><a id="FN_87" href="#FA_87">[87]</a>
On the occasion of the ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi Victoriae
Caesaris</span>,’ held July 20-30, 45 B.C. as a continuation of the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi</span>’ of Sept. 46 (old calendar)
a figure of ‘Victoria’ was borne in procession in close proximity to
an image of Caesar. The populace refrained from applause, the
cause being, according to Cicero, that ‘Victoria’ was
in bad company, through the presence of Caesar’s image
(Cic., Att., 13, 44, 1).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_88" href="#FA_88">[88]</a><span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
This is perhaps the most gratuitously extravagant statement in the
entire fragment of Nicolaus. His purpose is, as E. Meyer suggests
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Caesars Monarchie</span>, p. 517)
to place the blame for Caesar’s <a id="TA_36" href="#TN_36">monarchical</a>
aspirations upon his associates, some of whom flattered him excessively
while others deliberately urged him on with the intention of making him
ultimately an object of general hatred. The same tone is exhibited by Dio,
44, 3, and Plutarch, Caes., 57. Caesar was entirely well aware that he
was disliked, even by those whom he characterized as ‘easy going’:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego dubitem</span>,’ Caesar
is reported to have said,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quin <i>summo in odio sim</i>, quom M.
Cicero sedeat nec suo commodo me convenire possit? Atqui si quisquam
est facilis, hic est, tamen non dubito quin <i>me male oderit</i></span>’
(Cic., Att., 14, 1, 2). Again,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego nunc <i>tam sim stultus</i> ut hunc
ipsum facilem hominem putem mihi esse amicum, cum tam diu sedens
meum commodum exspectet?</span>’ (Cic., Att., 14, 2, 3).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_89" href="#FA_89">[89]</a> The
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatus consultum</span>,’ enacted
after the victory at Munda, is also referred to by Dio 43, 45. It
appears that Caesar permitted the elections by magistrates to
proceed nominally as before, by popular vote, but
that he was the actual determining factor as to who
should be elected (Dio 43, 47). Compare Appian 4, 91,
Cassius’ alleged speech to his soldiers.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_90" href="#FA_90">[90]</a><span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
Concerning Caesarion, called ‘Cyrus’ by Nicolaus,
the son of Caesar and Cleopatra, see Cic., Att., 14, 20, 2;
Dio 47, 31; Suet., Caes., 52; Aug. 17; Plut., Caes., 49;
Ant. 54. All but Nicolaus acknowledge that he really
was Caesar’s son, and Nicolaus is unable to prove the
falsity of the allegation. It would have been extremely
difficult for Caesar to have secured the legitimizing
of Caesarion because of the universal antipathy
in Rome toward Cleopatra and eastern institutions in
general; further, much as Caesar may have desired a
natural heir, his purpose could not best be served by
Caesarion, who was an infant when Caesar’s will was
drawn, in comparison with his great-nephew, then 18
years of age.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_91" href="#FA_91">[91]</a>
Mention of Caesar’s intention of establishing an
empire in the East, with a capital at Alexandria or
at Ilium is also made by Suetonius, Caes., 79. Both
he and Nicolaus tend toward rejecting the idea as absurd;
but the fact is significant that in the summer
of 48 B.C. Caesar granted freedom to Ilium (Strabo 13,
1, 27). R. Meyer (Kleine Schr. p. 467; Caesars Monarchie
p. 521) thinks the plan entirely logical, and
accepts the report as plausible. It would have been
far simpler for Caesar to retain and augment his pseudo-divine
attributes in the East than could ever have
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
been the case in Rome; at the same time, the rights
and privileges historically peculiar to Rome could
have been served by an independent city government.
The same question arose in Augustus’ time (Horace,
Od., 3, 3).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_92" href="#FA_92">[92]</a>
Compare Cicero’s remarks to Caesar concerning the
statue on the rostra (Cic., pro Deiot. 12, 34). Dio 44,
4 gives a confused account of two statues having been
erected on the rostra, one intended to represent
Caesar as savior of the citizens, and the other as
‘rescuer of the city from siege;’ the appropriateness
of this latter attribute seems somewhat obscure.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_93" href="#FA_93">[93]</a>
The full names of the tribunes were L. Caesetius
Flavus and C. Epidius Marullus (Suet., Caes., 79; Dio
44, 9).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_94" href="#FA_94">[94]</a>
For the precedent of the temple of Concordia as a
meeting place for the senate, see Cicero, Cat., 3, 21;
Phil. 2, 8, 19; Sallust, Cat., 46; Plutarch, Cic., 19.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_95" href="#FA_95">[95]</a>
The account of Nicolaus, involving banishment of
the tribunes, is at variance with the versions of
Appian, 2, 108; 4, 93; Dio 44, 10; 46, 9; Suetonius, Caes.,
79; Plutarch, Caes., 61; Ant. 12; Livy, Epit., 116, all
of whom concur in saying that the tribunes were merely
cast out of the senate, and not sent into exile. It
is shown by Cicero, Phil., 13, 15, 31, that the tribunes
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
were simply removed from office:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid ergo, ut Marullum,
ut Caesetium a republica removeremus, eum consecuti
sumus?</span>’ The term
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a republica</span>’ means ‘from
public life’ and not ‘from the country;’ compare Velleius
2, 68.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_96" href="#FA_96">[96]</a>
In a letter to Atticus (Cic., Att., 15, 44, 1) dated about July 20,
45 B.C., Cicero alludes to the reported proposal of Cotta that Caesar
be made king in order that Parthia might be subdued according to the
terms of the Sibylline prophecy which stated that Parthia would be proof
against any but a king (Cic., Div., 2, 110). Compare also the passage,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">munerum regiorum</span>’
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">regionum</span>?)
(Cic., Fam., 6, 19, 2; Tyrrell and Purser 5<sup>2</sup>, p. 162 and
note). On August 2, 45 B.C., Cicero actually speaks
of Caesar as ‘the king:’
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi viderem scire <i>regem</i> me
animi nihil habere</span>’ (Cic., Att., 25, 37, 2). The episode
of the diadem, involving the tribunes Caesetius and
Marullus, seems to have occurred in January, 44 B.C.

Mention of Licinius as being the first to present
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
to Caesar the diadem enclosed within a wreath is unique
with Nicolaus. Appian 2, 109; Dio 44, 11; Livy, Epit.,
116; Velleius 2, 56, 4; Plutarch, Caes., 60; Ant. 12, and
Cicero, Phil., 2, 84-85; 3, 12, all concur in that they
make Antony solely responsible for having offered the
crown to Caesar. Duttlinger,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Untersuchungen über den
historischen Wert des</span>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="bios Kaisaros">βίος Καίσαρος</span>,
Heidelberg 1911, endeavoring to align the account of Nicolaus with
Cicero’s words:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unde diadema? <i>non enim abjectum
sustuleras</i>, sed attuleras domo meditatum et cogitatum
scelus</span>’ (Cic., Phil., 2, 85) makes the following assertion:
‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Diese Worte zeigen mit unumstösslicher
Sicherheit, dass Caesar schon einmal, bevor Antonius kam,
das Diadem von sich gewiesen hatte</span>.’ A saner view is
expressed in the translation of the phrase by Halm-Laubmann,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ciceros Ausgewählte Reden</span>, vol. 6, p. 110:
‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">du konntest es nicht von der Strasse
aufgehoben, auf der Strasse gefunden haben</span>;’ thus no suggestion
of a former attempt by Licinius is to be read into Cicero’s
words. Cicero’s immediate purpose, of course, was to
bring discredit upon Antony for his actions on that
day of the Lupercalia, and hence any mention of Licinius
on his part would have been irrelevant to his case.
Cicero’s Philippics therefore afford no check upon the
accuracy of Nicolaus’ account, which rests here upon
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
its merits of priority in comparison with the versions
of the other historians.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_99" href="#FA_99">[99]</a>
It seems that the behavior of Lepidus at this juncture
was such as to attract attention; exactly what he
did can not be ascertained, but the indications are
that he kept himself strictly aloof. Cicero (Phil. 5, 38;
13, 17) wished to laud him, contrasting him with Antony.
At the place of the former citation he says of him:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Semper ille populum Romanum
liberum voluit maximumque signum illo die dedit voluntatis et
iudicii sui, cum Antonio diadema Caesari imponente <i>se avertit</i>,
gemituque et maestitia declaravit quantum haberet odium servitutis</span>,’
etc. Cicero thus (though for a purpose) represents
him as averse to autocracy, while Nicolaus suggests
that he was in sympathy with Antony’s action.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_100" href="#FA_100">[100]</a>
As tribune (Dio 44, 32).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_101" href="#FA_101">[101]</a>
The report that Caesar was addressed directly by the
crowd as king,
‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Chaire basileu">Χαῖρε βασιλεῦ</span>’
= ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">salve rex</span>,’ is given
by Nicolaus alone. In this connection, however, see
chap. 20, note <a id="FX101_96" href="#FN_96">96</a>, and especially Cic., Att., 13, 37, 2,
where Cicero refers to Caesar as ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">rex</span>’.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_102" href="#FA_102">[102]</a>
In comparison with the motive of Antony given here,
note the ridiculous reasons presented in the speech of
Fufius Calenus as published by Dio (46, 17-19). There
Antony is said to have offered the diadem for the very
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
purpose of shocking Caesar to reason and thus to cause
him to reject the proffered crown.</p>

13, p. 682 suggests that this section should follow immediately upon
the words at the beginning of section 21:
‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="toiauta men dê tote elegeto">τοιαῦτα μὲν δὴ τότε ἐλέγετο</span>,’
thus making a more connected account of the accusation of the tribunes
and their subsequent restitution. Since, however, Nicolaus is about to
write of the annual elections, his order of relating
these events is not unnatural.</p>

<p class="ft2">Nicolaus declares that Cinna secured the recall of
the tribunes through a decree passed while Caesar was yet alive;
Appian 2, 122 alludes to the tribunes as still being in exile on
March 16, 44 B.C., when Brutus and Cassius descended from the
Capitoline and urged that they be recalled. E. Meyer,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Caesars Monarchie</span>,
p. 527, n. 2, is inclined to favor the version of Nicolaus.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_104" href="#FA_104">[104]</a>
The decree was that of the tribune L. Antonius,
mentioned by Cicero (Phil. 7, 16). Suetonius, Caes., 41
and Dio 43, 51 refer to the legal right of Caesar to
appoint one half of the total number of magistrates
for 3 years in advance; at the expiration of this
period his return from his expedition against the
Parthians was to have been expected. The decree of
Antonius was enacted between December 10, 45 B.C.,
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the day on which the newly elected tribunes entered
into office, and March 15, 44 B.C. (see Sternkopf,
Ciceros ausgewählte Reden, vol. 9, p. 33).</p>

<p class="ft2">Appian, 2, 128; 2, 138, says that Caesar appointed
magistrates for 5 years in advance; Suetonius, Caes., 76, speaks of
‘several’ years; Nicolaus is corroborated by Cicero (Att. 14, 6, 2),
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Etiamne consules et tribunos
pl. in <i>biennium</i> quos ille voluit</span>.’ See also Cic., Fam.,
10, 32, 2. Among the historians, Nicolaus alone names
Pansa and Hirtius, Brutus and Plancus, but Cicero
speaks of the former pair as
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">consules designati</span>’ in
Philippic 3, 37 and 39, and of the latter pair as
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">consules designati</span>’
in Philippic 3, 38.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_105" href="#FA_105">[105]</a>Antony.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_106" href="#FA_106">[106]</a>
For the behavior of Caesar when the senate approached
him to confer its honors upon him, see Appian 2,
107; Dio 44, 8; Suetonius, Caes., 78; Plutarch, Caes.,
60; Livy, Epit., 116; <a id="TA_48" href="#TN_48">Eutropius</a> 6, 25; Zonaras 10, 11.
Appian and Plutarch speak of Caesar as seated on the
rostra; Dio, Suetonius, and Livy place him before the
temple of Venus Genetrix. In the interest of accuracy
it is to be noted that both Appian and Plutarch incorrectly
refer to ‘consuls’ in the plural as being at the head of the procession:
‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="tôn hypatôn hêgoumenôn">τῶν ὑπάτων ἡγουμένων</span>’ and
‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="prosiontôn de tôn hypatôn">προσιόντων δὲ τῶν
<a id="TA_49" href="#TN_49">ὑπάτων</a></span>.’</p>

<p class="ft2"><span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>Excuses
for Caesar’s failure to rise are offered
by three of the historians: Dio lays the blame upon
an attack of diarrhoea, Plutarch upon an attack of
epilepsy, while Nicolaus, less extravagantly, simply
says that Caesar did not at first see the throng because
of his deep interest in his own undertaking.
More plausible are the suggested reasons of Suetonius:
that L. Cornelius Balbus dissuaded Caesar from rising
(compare Plut., Caes., 60, end), or that C. Trebatius
Testa urged him to rise and thus displeased him.</p>

See also Appian 2, 106, 134, 138; Dio 44, 4; 5, 50.
After Caesar’s death Antony had inscribed upon a
statue of Caesar which he placed on the rostra,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">parenti optime merito</span>’
(Cic., Fam., 12, 3, 1). Suetonius, Caes., 85 tells of the
column erected in the forum, similarly inscribed,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">parenti patriae</span>.’</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_109" href="#FA_109">[109]</a>
See Appian 2, 107, 109; Dio 44, 7. Caesar’s motive in dismissing his
guard was found to be difficult to explain by those who afterward
sought for causes. To many it could not but seem almost suicidal
negligence (Suet., Caes., 86); certainly his course did not meet
with the favor of his more prudent adherents:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">laudandum experientia consilium est
Pansae atque Hirti, qui</span><span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>

As Pontifex Maximus, Caesar lived in the Regia, in

The bridge has been identified by M. E. Deutsch, University of California
Publications in Classical Philology, vol. 2, pp. 267 ff.
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Petronia amnis est in Tiberim
perfluens, quam magistratus auspicato transeunt cum in
campo quid agere volunt</span>’ (Festus 250). This stream, which flowed
westward from the Quirinal, was accordingly bridged by a small wooden
footway from which one might easily have been pushed into the shallow
watercourse below. Suetonius also refers to a
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pons</span>’ but seems erroneously
to have supposed it was the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pons</span>’ of the voting place.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_112" href="#FA_112">[112]</a> The

pp. 147 and 241. See also Ovid, Fast., 3, 523; Macrobius, Sat., 1, 12, 6).
Perhaps the reference is to the Quinquatrus of March 19 (Wissowa, op. cit.,
p. 144).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_113" href="#FA_113">[113]</a>
Suetonius, Caes., 80, alone agrees with Nicolaus
in recounting the four tentative plans discussed by
the conspirators before it was decided that Caesar be
killed in the senate on March 15, but he is far less
explicit. According to Appian, 2, 115, Caesar was to
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
have set out for the East within four days of that
date; hence the conspirators must have felt that there
was no time to lose. The motions which Caesar wished
to introduce at this session of the senate referred to
final preparations and assignments before he departed
for Parthia. Dio 44, 15, says that Brutus and Cassius
felt that the motion might be put that Caesar be declared
king in order to assure victory over the Parthians
in accordance with a Sibylline prophecy (see
chap. 20, <a id="TA_26B" href="#TN_26">note</a>
<a id="FX113_96" href="#FN_96">96</a>),
and since they could not vote for the
measure, from conviction, nor against it, from policy,
they decided to kill him before suspicion should become
directed against themselves. In this connection, see
Appian 2, 113; Plutarch, Brut., 10, where attempts have
been made to reproduce the supposed dialog between
Brutus and Cassius on the subject.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">24.</span><a id="FN_114" href="#FA_114">[114]</a>
According to the Greek mode of orientation to the
east, which Nicolaus has in mind, the back of one sacrificing
would be kept toward the west. The Romans followed
the Etruscan rule of facing south, in which case
the west, being on the right, would not be an unfavorable
quarter.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_115" href="#FA_115">[115]</a>
The codex reading is
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="ekeleuse">ἐκέλευσε</span>,
obviously incorrect. Müller emends to
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="ethelêse">ἐθέλησε</span>; Piccolos and Dindorf to
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="epeneuse">ἐπένευσε</span>. It has been thought
advisable to render<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
here as if
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="ekeleue">ἐκέλευε</span> were written, thus
adhering more closely to the actual text. For the use of the imperfect
to denote attempted action, compare Hdt. 1, 68,
‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="emisthouto par’ ouk ekdidontos tên aulên">ἐμισθοῦτο παρ’ <i>οὐκ ἐκδιδόντος</i> τὴν αὐλήν.</span>’
(Godwin, G. M. T. 36).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_116" href="#FA_116">[116]</a>
Literally, ‘he seemed to do something rather bold
for one holding his hands inside.’ Didot renders as
though Caesar were referred to as keeping his hands
beneath his toga:
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrivé près de César, qui tenait
ses mains sous sa toge.</span>’ It is scarcely possible to derive
such an interpretation from the Greek as it stands. The translation
‘for a suppliant’ was suggested by Plautus, Amph., 257,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">velatis manibus orant,
ignoscamus peccatum suom.</span>’ There ‘veiled hands’
(bearing fillets) are a mark of supplication;
‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="eisô tas cheiras echontos">εἴσω τὰς χεῖρας ἔχοντος</span>’
as applied to Cimber may have a
similar meaning, particularly since he is described
as feigning to intercede with Caesar for his brother;
and Nicolaus may not have understood the Latin expression
(compare App. 2, 117; Suet., Caes., 82; Plut., Caes.
66; Brut. 17).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_117" href="#FA_117">[117]</a>
Appian 2, 117; Suet., Caes., 82; Livy, Epit., 116;
Florus 2, 13, 95; Zonaras 10, 11 D; Eutropius 6, 25;
Valerius Maximus 4, 5, 6; Plutarch, Caes., 66, mention
23 wounds; Dio 44, 19, speaks of ‘many’ wounds; Nicolaus
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
alone gives the number as 35. O. E. Schmidt,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrb. für class. Philol.</span>,
sup. 13, p. 674, suggests that there may
have been two traditions at the time of Nicolaus, one
involving 23 wounds, the other 35. This belief is
scarcely justifiable, since there is but one example
of the latter tradition, and Suetonius, whose account
usually coincides with that of Nicolaus, is here at
variance. Piccolos,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nicolas de Damas, Vie de César</span>,
p. 89 shows how the capitals
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="K">Κ</span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="G">Γ</span> (23)
may have become corrupted to
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="E">Ε</span> and

due to the excerptor.</p>

A slight lacuna exists here.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_119" href="#FA_119">[119]</a>
Brutus, as spokesman for the assassins, is here
described as attempting to deliver a formal address
to the multitude immediately after the murder and before
the conspirators fled to the Capitoline. A similar
implication is found in Dio 44, 20-21, though
Brutus is not there mentioned by name. Appian 2, 119,
suggests rather that the slayers simply ran, shouting
random remarks in defense of their deed.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_120" href="#FA_120">[120]</a>
So also Appian 2, 114; Plutarch, Brut., 18, 2; Ant. 13, 2;
Velleius 2, 58. Dio, 44, 19, says that the decision not to kill
Antony was duly reached, but here Brutus is not named as being
the influential factor. Cicero (Att., 15, 12, 2) seems to refer
with some petulance to<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
the reputation for lenience which Brutus created for himself:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. quidem Antonius liberaliter
litteris sine cura me esse iubet. Habeo unum beneficium, alterum
fortasse, si in Tusculanum venerit. O negotia non
ferenda! quae feruntur tamen.</span>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="tan d’ aitian tôn Broutôn tis echei">τὰν δ’ αἰτίαν τῶν Βρούτων τις ἔχει.</span>’
Again (Att. 15, 20, 2)
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">foedum ducens et quasi denuntiatum
nobis ab Antonio ex hac nassa exire constitui ... haec omnis culpa
Bruti.</span>’ A year later Cicero again alludes to Brutus’ policy
concerning Antony at the time of the murder of Caesar:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tu lenius</span>’ (Cic.,
ad Brut., 2, 5, 1).</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">26.</span><a id="FN_121" href="#FA_121">[121]</a>
It is not elsewhere mentioned that Caesar intended
to make an expedition against the Indians.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_122" href="#FA_122">[122]</a>
C. Calvisius Sabinus, consul in 39 B.C., was in the
year 48 with Caesar (Caes., B. C., 3, 34). In 38 he held
a command in Octavian’s fleet, at that time engaged
with Sextus Pompeius (App. 5, 80-81), and in the year
36 he was <a id="TA_50" href="#TN_50">superseded</a> by Agrippa because of his failure
to prevent the desertion of one of his subordinates
(App. 5, 96). Marcius Censorinus, probably praetor in
43 B.C., is spoken of as a Caesarian and an Antonian
in Att. 14, 10, 2; Phil. 11, 36; 13, 2, but their attempt
to defend Caesar is mentioned only by Nicolaus.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_123" href="#FA_123">[123]</a>
So also Appian 2, 118; Suetonius, Caes., 82.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">26 b.</span><a id="FN_124" href="#FA_124">[124]</a>
Compare Appian 2, 115; Dio 44, 16. The part played
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
by Decimus Brutus in engaging the services of the
gladiators is referred to by Appian 2, 122; Plutarch,
Brut. 12.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_125" href="#FA_125">[125]</a>
As has been seen (chap. 22, note <a id="FX125_109" href="#FN_109">109</a>) there were, in
fact, no guards. See also Appian 2, 118: ‘there was no
detachment of soldiers about Caesar, for he did not
care for guards.’</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_126" href="#FA_126">[126]</a>
A slight lacuna exists here.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_127" href="#FA_127">[127]</a>
The second speech of Brutus was delivered in the afternoon of March
15. So also Plutarch, Brut., 18, 3-4. Plutarch, Caes., 67, 3 seems
to imply that this same address took place on the following day:
‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="meth’ hêmeran de tôn peri Brouton katelthontôn kai poiêsamenôn logous">μεθ’ ἡμέραν δὲ τῶν περὶ
<a id="TA_51" href="#TN_51">Βροῦτον</a>
κατελθόντων καὶ ποιησαμένων λόγους.</span>’
Appian 2, 122 states that Brutus descended from the
Capitoline, the wound in his hand still fresh, and,
together with Cassius, spoke in the forum. The rather
unexpected praise of Brutus may be an indication that
Nicolaus is using Pollio’s histories.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">27.</span><a id="FN_128" href="#FA_128">[128]</a>
This is the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">contio Capitolina prima</span>’ which was
held on March 15, late in the day, and at which Cicero was present.
He endeavored to secure a convocation of the senate, to be summoned
by Brutus and Cassius on their authority as praetors, so that they
might be legally confirmed as tyrannicides, thus forestalling
any attempt on the part of the Caesarians and the <span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Antonians to have them proclaimed murderers (Cic., Att. 14, 10, 1,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">meministine me clamare illo ipso primo Capitolino
die debere senatum in Capitolium a praetoribus vocari,</span>’ etc.
Also Cic., Phil., 2, 89). This meeting on the Capitoline should not be
confused with a second
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">contio Capitolina</span>’ referred to by
Cicero (Att., 15, 1 b, 2), and which seems to have been subsequent to the
meeting of the senate in the temple of Tellus on March
17, when Cicero was able to secure only a rather unsatisfactory
compromise for the members of the republican
faction. See the note of Tyrrell and Purser,
The Correspondence of Cicero, vol. 5, p. 307.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_129" href="#FA_129">[129]</a>
The temple of <a id="TA_27B" href="#TN_27">Jupiter</a> Capitolinus is,
of course, to be understood.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_130" href="#FA_130">[130]</a>
The despatch of messengers from the conspirators to Antony and Lepidus
is also told of by Appian 2, 123.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_131" href="#FA_131">[131]</a>
Appian 2, 126 and Dio 44, 22 both make special note
of the fact that Lepidus had an armed force in the
city before daybreak on March 17. Appian, however,
in the same passage asserts that Antony did not bring
in any troops, so as not to disturb the city.</p>

Between the sections 27 and 28 the excerptor has
perhaps omitted a portion of his original material.
Much of what is told by Nicolaus in section 27 is
given in far greater detail than is the case with the
other historians. The events related in this chapter,
especially the interchange of messengers between Antony
and Lepidus and Brutus and Cassius, have been thought
to have had a very close connection with the circumstances
which occasioned the writing of Cic., Fam., 11, 1, a letter
from D. Brutus to M. Brutus and Cassius. O. E. Schmidt,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neue Jahrb. für Philol. und Paed.</span>,
129, wishes therefore to date the letter in the morning of
March 17; P. Gröbe,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Drumann-Gröbe Geschichte Roms</span>,
1<sup>2</sup>, p. 411 ff., would place the letter still earlier, on
March 16. E. T. Merrill, Class. Philol. 10, p. 241 ff.,
has now shown that D. Brutus’ allusions to the disposition
of Antony and Hirtius toward him may well have
been relevant to a later period, and hence he would
set the date of the letter as late as April 10, thus
approximating Schmidt’s original view, which gave
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
April 5 as the probable time of writing
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Correspondenz Ciceros in den
Jahren 44 und 43</span>, Marburg 1883).
It follows therefore that chapter 27 of Nicolaus should
not be employed as a criterion on the date of Cic.,
Fam., 11, 1.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">28.</span><a id="FN_136" href="#FA_136">[136]</a>
Lacuna, which is apparently quite long, for the affairs
mentioned in the following belong to June and
July, whereas the story of Octavian told before chapter
19 was only of his return to Rome in April.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_137" href="#FA_137">[137]</a>
The aedile Critonius is probably referred to (compare
App. 3, 28). The proper name may have been lost
in the lacuna immediately above.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_138" href="#FA_138">[138]</a>
Compare Appian 3, 28; Dio 45, 6; Suetonius, Caes., 88;
Plutarch, Ant., 16; Pliny, N. H., 2, 23. Since both Appian
and Nicolaus refer to two controversies between Octavian
and Antony, of which the second was at the time of the
festival of Venus Genetrix in July, the question has
arisen as to what the earlier occasion could have been. The
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi Cereales</span>’ are precluded,
for Octavian was in Campania during the period in which they
were held, April 12-19 (Cic., Att., 14, 12, 2). The
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi Florales</span>’
were given April 28-May 3, and since Cicero on May
22 referred to the episode of the throne (Att. 15, 3, 2)
these must have been the games at which Octavian experienced
his difficulty for the first time, unless it<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
can be shown that the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi Cereales</span>’ were postponed
for a month, in which event they would have also been
completed just prior to Cicero’s letter of May 22.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_139" href="#FA_139">[139]</a>
See Appian 3, 21; 3, 23; Dio 45, 7. According to Appian’s
account, Octavian liquidated not only the residuary
estate which he received from Caesar, but also some of
his own property in order to pay the specific legacies
to the people. This would naturally make them feel
indebted to him as well as to his late uncle, and was
a particularly shrewd bit of strategy on his part in
winning popular opinion away from Antony.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_140" href="#FA_140">[140]</a>
Antony and Dolabella.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_141" href="#FA_141">[141]</a>
Antony is accused of having made away with 700,000,000
sesterces (approximately $30,000,000) (Cic., Phil., 1, 17;
2, 35; 2, 93; 4, 14; 5, 11; Att. 14, 14, 5; Fam. 12, 2, 2; Vell.
2, 60, 4). Antony’s obvious defense was that the Caesarian
treasury, the temple of Ops, had been left exhausted by
Caesar (App. 3, 20).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_142" href="#FA_142">[142]</a>
During April and May Antony was corresponding with Brutus and
Cassius, both verbally and by letter. The general impression
given by Cicero is that a friendly compromise was not improbable:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antoni colloquium cum heroibus
nostris pro re nata non incommodum.</span>’ (Cic.,
Att., 14, 6, 1, written April 12)
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epistula brevis quae
postea a te scripta est sane mihi fuit iucunda, de
Bruti ad Antonium ... litteris</span><span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>’
(Cic., Att., 14, 14, postscript). The appeal of Brutus and Cassius
to Antony (Cic., Fam., 11, 2), as to what their chance for safety
would be in Rome, was sent from Lanuvium toward the end of May.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_143" href="#FA_143">[143]</a> Lacuna.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_144" href="#FA_144">[144]</a>
These men seem to belong to the ‘middle group’ just
mentioned before the Lacuna. Nicolaus assumes that
they are not genuine friends of Octavian but egg him on
against Antony for purposes of their own. That they
did so as Cicero certainly did for the sake of preserving
the constitution he neglects to say. ‘Vibius’ is
of course C. Vibius Pansa, one of the consuls designated
for 43, who though formerly a friend of Antony
was induced by Cicero to support the senate in view of
his coming consulship. He was friendly to Octavian
but would hardly have supported Octavian’s ambitions
to the full. Lucius may well be L. Julius Caesar, consul
of 64 B.C., and Antony’s uncle; see Pauly-Wiss.
<i>Julius</i> 145. He opposed his nephew Antony in 44 and
supported the senate, though he also tried to restrain
the senate from declaring open war on Antony in 43.
We are not told what his attitude toward Octavian was,
but his opposition to Antony, his frequent support of
Cicero, his desire for peace, and his friendship for
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
conservatives like L. Piso, P. Servilius Vatia, Servius
Sulpicius, and Philippus make it probable that he
favored Octavian’s opposition of Antony without supporting
Octavian’s extreme ambitions. E. Schwartz (Hermes
33, p. 184) suggests that L. Piso is here referred to.
This is possible, but in view of the fact that L.
Julius Caesar was proscribed by the triumvirs in 43,
it is more likely that he is the one attacked by Nicolaus.</p>

<p class="ft2">The Publius referred to is probably P. Servilius
Vatia. He was a man of little force of character, who
half-heartedly supported the senate against Antony in
44 and 43. The fact that Lucius Caesar, against Cicero’s
advice, nominated him in 43 as proconsul to oppose
Dolabella, proves that he belongs to the moderate
group which did not wish to offend Caesar’s soldiers
or Octavian by giving open support to Brutus and Cassius
(Cic., Phil., 11, 19). Brutus (Cic., ad Brut., 1, 16)
as early as May, 43, took Cicero to task for commending
his own safety to Octavian; in ad Brut. 1, 17, 5, he alludes
to the terms to which Octavian had come with Cicero,
in that the youth addressed the elder man as
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pater</span>’.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_145" href="#FA_145">[145]</a>
Gallia Narbonensis (compare Dio 43, 51). Lepidus
became triumvir with Antony and Octavian in 43.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_146" href="#FA_146">[146]</a>
See Cic., Phil., 5, 6; Fam. 10, 1, ff. Plancus had
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
been nominated consul for the year 42 by Caesar. He
held Gallia Comata under the provisions of the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex Julia</span>,’
concerning the assignment of provinces. Antony
endeavored to displace him through the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex tribunicia de provinciis</span>,’
enacted in the early part of June, 44, but his position was confirmed by a
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatus consultum</span>’
of December 20, which provided that the provincial
governors should retain their tenures until the senate
itself should appoint successors (Cic., Phil., 3, 38).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_147" href="#FA_147">[147]</a>
Compare Dio 45, 10; App. 4, 84. Pollio was already
in his province when Caesar was murdered, according to
his reference to the Ides of March in Cic., Fam., 10, 31, 4.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_148" href="#FA_148">[148]</a> See App. 3, 2; Cic., Att., 14, 13, 2. D. Brutus had
gone to his province in April 44 B.C.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_149" href="#FA_149">[149]</a>
Brutus’ official name was Q. Servilius Caepio after
his adoption by his uncle, though he continued to be
called M. Junius Brutus by his friends. ‘Gaius’ is
probably an error of the excerptor.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_150" href="#FA_150">[150]</a>
For the year 44, the lawful praetor for Macedonia
was Q. Hortensius (Cic., Phil., 10, 11; 10, 13; 10, 26).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_151" href="#FA_151">[151]</a>
Syria was under L. Staius Murcus, followed by Q.
Marcius Crispus (App. 3, 77) until the advent of Cassius
(Dio 47, 27-28; Cic., Fam., 12, 11, 1; 12, 12, 3). There is
confusion among the historians as to what provinces
were actually assigned to Brutus and Cassius for the
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
year 43. Appian 3, 2; 3, 7-8; 3, 12; 3, 16; 3, 24; 3, 36;
4, 37, states that Brutus and Cassius were appointed
for Macedonia and Syria. Florus 2, 17, 4 says also that
Caesar had given them Macedonia and Syria. Plutarch,
Caes., 57; Ant. 14; Cic. 42; Brut. 19, as consistently
state that Brutus and Cassius received no provinces
until after Caesar’s death; the senate ultimately
assigned Crete and ‘Libya’ (Plut., Brut., 19). Dio 47,
21 explicitly states that Macedonia and Syria never
were given to Brutus and Cassius, but that Crete and
Bithynia were. Appian 3, 8 mentions Cyrenaica and
Crete, and as an alternative report, Cyrenaica and
Crete for Cassius and Bithynia for Brutus. The sequel
is, of course, well known. Brutus and Cassius seized
Macedonia and Syria forcibly. W. Sternkopf, Hermes
47, pp. 340-347, has shown that the versions of Appian
and Florus, that Caesar had given Macedonia and Syria
to Brutus and Cassius for the year 43, are incorrect.
Perhaps his most cogent point is that Cicero nowhere
condemns Antony and Dolabella for having diverted from
Brutus and Cassius provinces originally ordained for
them. In fact Cicero (Phil. 11, 27-30) endorses Brutus
and Cassius for having appropriated provinces which
belonged, according to written law
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">legibus scriptis</span>)
to others
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Macedoniam alienam;
Syriam, alienam provinciam</span>).
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
It should be noticed that the phrase of Nicolaus regarding Brutus,
‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Makedonia de G. Broutos ephedros ên">Μακεδονίᾳ
δὲ Γ. Βροῦτος ἔφεδρος <a id="TA_52" href="#TN_52">ἦν</a></span>’
is not entirely clear. It is just possible that
Appian’s grave error is due to a misunderstanding of
Nicolaus or of Nicolaus’ source if that also contained
some ambiguous expression like
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="ephedros">ἔφεδρος</span>.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_152" href="#FA_152">[152]</a>
Caesar had not bequeathed his position in the state
to Octavian, though he had doubtless intended, should
he live long enough, to be able eventually to name his
successor. This passage is interesting in revealing
the point of view of Octavian, whose memoirs Nicolaus
used.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">29.</span><a id="FN_153" href="#FA_153">[153]</a>
According to App. 3, 28, Octavian himself, accompanied
by a following of civilians, canvassed the plebeians,
endeavoring to excite their anger against Antony.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_154" href="#FA_154">[154]</a>
In Appian’s account (3, 29-30, 39) Antony is said to
have been in need of Octavian’s assistance in order to
procure the exchange of provinces.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_155" href="#FA_155">[155]</a>
A lacuna here intervenes, so that the account of the
actual reconciliation is wanting. Appian, 3, 29-30, 39,
agrees in the main with Nicolaus; Antony is influenced
by his military tribunes, former soldiers of Caesar.
In Dio 45, 8 Octavian and Antony are said to have made
mutual concessions. According to Plutarch, Ant., 16,
Antony became apprehensive on finding that Octavian
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
had joined forces with his more powerful foes, among
whom was Cicero.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">30.</span><a id="FN_156" href="#FA_156">[156]</a>
For a commentary on the swing of public opinion
from Antony to Octavian, see App. 3; 12, 21, 23, 24, 29;
Dio 45, 8; Plut., Ant., 16. R. Duttlinger, op. cit.,
pp. 77-78, directs attention to the fact that Appian
presents Antony in a fairer light in this connection
than do Nicolaus, Dio, or Plutarch, thus indicating a
probable diversity of sources.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_157" href="#FA_157">[157]</a>
On the authority of the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex de permutatione provinciarum</span>’
of June 1-2, 44 B.C. W. Sternkopf, Hermes 47, p. 357 ff. and
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ciceros ausgewählte Reden</span>, vol. 8,
p. 9 and note, declares that this act is identical with the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex tribunicia de provinciis</span>,’
both having been ratified at the same meeting. The former term is employed
by Livy, Epit., 117; the latter by Cicero, Phil.,
5, 7. The combined result was that Antony should have
part or all of Gaul in place of Macedonia, and that
both consuls should enjoy an imperium extended for
five years. In the historians the references to the
exchange of provinces are: Dio 45; 9, 20, 25; 46; 23, 24;
Appian 3; 27, 29, 30, 31, 37, 38, 52, 55, 63.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_158" href="#FA_158">[158]</a>
Antony left Rome October 9:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antonius autem ... a.d. VII Id. Oct.
Brundisium erat profectus</span>’ (Cic., Fam., 12,
23, 2). Also App. 3, 40.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_159" href="#FA_159">[159]</a><span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
This is the only occurrence of the spelling ‘Atia’
in the excerpt. Elsewhere the name is given ‘Antia’.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_160" href="#FA_160">[160]</a>
Appian 3, 39, and Plutarch, Ant., 16, both seem to
discredit the report that Octavian made an attempt
against Antony’s life, though they do not endeavor to
deny it so vigorously as does Nicolaus. Suetonius,
Aug. 10; Velleius 2, 60, and Seneca, de Clem., 1, 9, 1, all
indicate that the attempt was really made. Cicero,
Fam., 12, 23, 2, both believes and approves of it,
though it is possible that he was carried away by his
own desire rather than that he weighed conclusive
contemporaneous evidence. He remarks, however, that
the populace did not believe it, and that Antony never
gave a report on the prisoners he was supposed to have
seized. In Phil. 3, 19, he goes so far as to take upon
himself the credit for having urged Octavian to the
deed. The circumstantial refutation of Nicolaus comes
doubtless from Augustus’ memoirs.</p>

<p class="ft0"><span class="fs0">31.</span><a id="FN_161" href="#FA_161">[161]</a>
Lacuna. Octavian’s exploit in securing enlistments
in Campania is referred to by the following: App. 3;
40, 58; Dio 45; 12, 38; Suet., Aug., 10; Vell. 2, 61; Plut.,
Ant., 16; Cic. 44; Tac., Ann., 1, 10; Cic., Phil., 3, 3; 4, 3;
5, 23, 44. Nicolaus is unique in stating that Octavian
first approached the Seventh and Eighth Legions. Both
of these were composed of veterans (Cic., Phil., 14, 27;
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
CIL 10, 4786). Beside the fact that Octavian offered
an inducement toward enlisting to the extent of 500
denarii ($80) to each man, the veterans were glad to
aid him oppose Antony because of a new colony established
by the latter near Casilinum (Cic., Phil., 2,
100-102) which served to make Antony unpopular with
the Caesarian veterans who had a prior claim to the
ground. (M. Cary, Journal of Philology, 70, pp. 174-190,
treats of the land legislation of Caesar in regard to
Campania. He is of the opinion that Casilinum and
Calatia, being settled by veterans of the Civil War,
must have been founded under a later statute than the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex Campana</span>’ of 59 B.C.)
Octavian’s levy was not authorized; it was therefore a revolutionary
measure. Nicolaus takes pains to show that Octavian reached
his decision only after Antony proved that he was
destined upon war. In this Nicolaus apparently makes
a good case: Antony left for Brundisium on October 9,
and Octavian is represented as forming his decision
and departing for Campania a few days later. Confirmation
comes from Cicero, who on November 2 wrote significantly
to Atticus (16, 8), ‘On the afternoon of the
first I had a letter from Octavian. He is making a
great undertaking. The veterans at Casilinum and
Calatia he has won over to his side. Nor is this
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
strange; he gives 500 denarii apiece. Evidently he
means to wage war with Antony. And so I see that in a
few days we shall be in arms. But whom are we to follow?
Consider his name and his age.’</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_162" href="#FA_162">[162]</a>
Q. Juventius and M. Modialius are unknown. L.
Maecenas is incorrectly written for C. Maecenas, of
whom this seems to be the earliest mention. M. Agrippa
had been a companion of Octavian at Apollonia. ‘Lucius’
may be L. Cocceius Nerva, great-grandfather of the
emperor Nerva. He is mentioned as a trusted friend of
Octavian in 41, and thence throughout his life.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_163" href="#FA_163">[163]</a> The several references to his mother could only have
come from Augustus’ own memoirs.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_164" href="#FA_164">[164]</a> Appian 3, 24, incorrectly states that Brutus and
Cassius left Italy shortly after the ‘ludi Apollinares’
in July. Dio 47, 20, is more accurate in saying that
they delayed in Campania for a time. Cic., Fam. 11, 3,
was sent from Naples August 4 by Brutus and Cassius to
Antony; and Cicero addressed Cassius at Puteoli in the
early part of October (Cic., Fam., 12, 2; 12, 3). Brutus
and Cassius would scarcely have been concerned over
the news of the young Octavian’s preparations; their
departure, though it coincided in time with Octavian’s
levy was not caused by this.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_165" href="#FA_165">[165]</a> Calatia was apparently the home of the Seventh Legion,
<span class="pagenum pnf" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
since he had decided to approach this first. His effort
was successful, for the Seventh Legion took part in the
battle of Forum Gallorum (Cic., Phil., 14, 10, 27).</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_166" href="#FA_166">[166]</a> The next colony was apparently Casilinum, where was
the Eighth Legion.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_167" href="#FA_167">[167]</a> According to Cicero (Fam., 12, 23, 2) Octavian went in
person to Brundisium to win over the four legions just
arrived from Macedonia.</p>

<p class="ft1"><a id="FN_168" href="#FA_168">[168]</a> Appian mentions this means of propaganda in 3; 31, 39,
44. His first reference to it in 3, 31 antedates his
account of Octavian’s alleged attempt against Antony’s
life; this anticipation is of course incorrect.</p>
